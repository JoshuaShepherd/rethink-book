# PRINCIPLE 12: RETHINK SCORECARDS

What if our church saw as its goal the Kingdom of God in­
stead of the number of bodies it gathered and organized
into straight rows? —Jeff Christopherson
In the 1950s, a 33-year-old left-handed pitcher made major league
baseball history. Harvey Haddix struck out 27 consecutive batters.
After nine innings, the scoreboard read all zeroes. No runs, no hits,
no errors, no walks.
But Harvey’s teammates forgot something amid their excitement
over his historic performance. The scoreboard had another zero. The
game was not over. It was tied. Harvey would go on to pitch another
amazing three innings, 12 full innings of perfect pitching.
So, why have so few people heard of Harvey Haddix and arguably
the greatest game ever pitched? Because he lost the game. Harvey’s
team failed to score, and the Braves ultimately reached the plate in
the thirteenth inning because of an error.29
What does this 1950s baseball game have to do with the church in
North America? I would argue that it is entirely possible for church
leaders to have impressive statistics regarding filled seats and still lose
the game because they have little to no effect in their community. It’s
possible to grow a “great” church but fail to make disciples. It doesn’t
have to be this way. Church leaders must stop being enamored with
just one side of the scoreboard.

When it comes to “keeping score,” churches in North America typically
focus on three metrics: buildings, budgets, and butts. While there is
nothing inherently wrong with counting these things, we do need to
ask if keeping score of how big our buildings are, how much money
people give, and how many people show up is the best indicator of
how a church is doing. Do these metrics really measure how incar­
nationally the body of Christ is living?
The fact is that these three metrics give us no real sense of the influ­
ence a church has on its community. Do the number of people who
attend a Sunday morning gathering give you any indication of the
impact the church is having on individual neighborhoods or the city?
The answer is a resounding no! There is no correlation between the
number of people who show up for an event and the difference those
people are making where they live. The same is true with how much
money people give to the church and how large a church’s buildings
are. The reason we “count” those three things is because they are easy
to count. But we must rethink to not count what is easy but measure
what is important.

While we often use the language of “counting” and “measuring”
interchangeably, there is a difference between the two. We must make
the distinction because the church has largely been in the counting
business, which has negatively influenced the way we think about
the nature of the church and limited our **multiplication** and impact
in the world. We need to move to measuring more and counting less.
Counting gives attention to numbers. The question is “How many?”
It is quantitative. Conversations about “How many?” are frequently
conversations about resources but can also be about activities. Conver­
sations about resources, in a time of limited resources, become conver­
sations about sufficiency, “Do we have enough?” or, “How can we get
more?” Examples could include finances or people. We ask questions
like, “Do we have enough money for that mission?” or “Do we have
enough volunteers for that ministry?” A quantitative question about
activities might be, “How many Bible studies took place this week?”
Measuring gives attention to change. When measuring, the question is
“How far?” It is qualitative. Conversations about “How far?” frequently
involve change that can be measured over a particular time, as
in, “How far have we come over the past year?” “Has the quality of
something changed over time? Has something gotten better, or worse,
since the last time we measured?”
There is a need for both counting and measuring. In all complex
organizations, multiple tools are needed. However, like all tools, the
right tool must be chosen for the job at hand. So, what should we
count and what should we measure?
I hesitate to be too prescriptive because contexts are different. But
let me suggest some possibilities that will hopefully crack open your
imagination for metrics that fit your community. Think of these as
conversation starters for the scorecard your church should be tracking.

One of the things we should count are missionary behaviors. For
example:
•	 How many neighbors have I gotten to know by name in the
past month?
•	 How many coworkers have I gotten to know on a deeper level?
•	 How many people have I had in my home this past month?
•	 How many meals have I shared with people outside my church
family this week?
•	 How many times this week have I intentionally been a blessing
to someone?
What other missionary behaviors can you track that would help you
see if your church was living with gospel intentionality?
*In **missional** Renaissance*, Reggie Mc Neal suggests developing new
scorecards around six resources of the church: prayer, people, time,
finances, facilities, and technology. Here are a few ideas from each
category to rethink outside the walls of the church.30
Prayer
•	 Number of people being prayed for both inside and outside
the church
•	 Number of people prayed with during the week by church
members
•	 Number of prayer meetings conducted off church property
•	 Number of prayer answers reported back to the church
•	 Number of community leaders adopted and prayed for each
week
•	 Number of prayer walks taken in the community or
neighborhoods
•	 Number of prayer cards received from community prayer
boxes
•	 Time spent in prayer in staff meetings for community needs
•	 Number of times each week school teachers are prayed for/
over
People
•	 Number of people engaged in financial planning
•	 Number of people growing in financial giving to kingdom
causes
•	 Number of people engaged in daily spiritual formation
•	 Number of people pursuing an intentional learning agenda
•	 Number of people reporting increased friendships over time
•	 Number of people sent into trailer parks, apartments, retire­
ment centers
•	 Number of community ministries adopted by church groups
or classes
•	 Number of people serving other people in some venue
•	 Number of people serving as mentors
•	 Number of people practicing an intentional blessing strategy
Time and Calendar
•	 Amount of time spent debriefing people engaged in commu­
nity service
•	 Time spent in mentoring people in the community beyond
the church
