RETHINK SCORECARDS
What if our church saw as its goal the Kingdom of God in-
stead of the number of bodies it gathered and organized 
into straight rows? —Jeff Christopherson
In the 1950s, a 33-year-old left-handed pitcher made major league 
baseball history. Harvey Haddix struck out 27 consecutive batters. 
After nine innings, the scoreboard read all zeroes. No runs, no hits, 
no errors, no walks. 
But Harvey’s teammates forgot something amid their excitement 
over his historic performance. The scoreboard had another zero. The 
game was not over. It was tied. Harvey would go on to pitch another 
amazing three innings, 12 full innings of perfect pitching.
So, why have so few people heard of Harvey Haddix and arguably 
the greatest game ever pitched? Because he lost the game. Harvey’s 
team failed to score, and the Braves ultimately reached the plate in 
the thirteenth inning because of an error.

What does this 1950s baseball game have to do with the church in 
North America? I would argue that it is entirely possible for church 
leaders to have impressive statistics regarding filled seats and still lose 
the game because they have little to no effect in their community. It’s 
possible to grow a “great” church but fail to make disciples. It doesn’t 
have to be this way. Church leaders must stop being enamored with 
just one side of the scoreboard.
THE THREE COMMON METRICS
When it comes to “keeping score,” churches in North America typically 
focus on three metrics: buildings, budgets, and butts. While there is 
nothing inherently wrong with counting these things, we do need to 
ask if keeping score of how big our buildings are, how much money 
people give, and how many people show up is the best indicator of 
how a church is doing. Do these metrics really measure how incar-
nationally the body of Christ is living? 
The fact is that these three metrics give us no real sense of the influ-
ence a church has on its community. Do the number of people who 
attend a Sunday morning gathering give you any indication of the 
impact the church is having on individual neighborhoods or the city? 
The answer is a resounding no! There is no correlation between the 
number of people who show up for an event and the difference those 
people are making where they live. The same is true with how much 
money people give to the church and how large a church’s buildings 
are. The reason we “count” those three things is because they are easy 
to count. But we must rethink to not count what is easy but measure 
what is important.
COUNTING AND MEASURING
While we often use the language of “counting” and “measuring” 
interchangeably, there is a difference between the two. We must make 

76
the distinction because the church has largely been in the counting 
business, which has negatively influenced the way we think about 
the nature of the church and limited our multiplication and impact 
in the world. We need to move to measuring more and counting less.
Counting gives attention to numbers. The question is “How many?” 
It is quantitative. Conversations about “How many?” are frequently 
conversations about resources but can also be about activities. Conver-
sations about resources, in a time of limited resources, become conver-
sations about sufficiency, “Do we have enough?” or, “How can we get 
more?” Examples could include finances or people. We ask questions 
like, “Do we have enough money for that mission?” or “Do we have 
enough volunteers for that ministry?” A quantitative question about 
activities might be, “How many Bible studies took place this week?”
Measuring gives attention to change. When measuring, the question is 
“How far?” It is qualitative. Conversations about “How far?” frequently 
involve change that can be measured over a particular time, as 
in, “How far have we come over the past year?” “Has the quality of 
something changed over time? Has something gotten better, or worse, 
since the last time we measured?”
There is a need for both counting and measuring. In all complex 
organizations, multiple tools are needed. However, like all tools, the 
right tool must be chosen for the job at hand. So, what should we 
count and what should we measure? 
I hesitate to be too prescriptive because contexts are different. But 
let me suggest some possibilities that will hopefully crack open your 
imagination for metrics that fit your community. Think of these as 
conversation starters for the scorecard your church should be tracking.

77
COUNTING
One of the things we should count are missionary behaviors. For 
example:
• How many neighbors have I gotten to know by name in the 
past month?
• How many coworkers have I gotten to know on a deeper level?
• How many people have I had in my home this past month?
• How many meals have I shared with people outside my church 
family this week?
• How many times this week have I intentionally been a blessing 
to someone?
What other missionary behaviors can you track that would help you 
see if your church was living with gospel intentionality?
In Missional Renaissance, Reggie McNeal suggests developing new 
scorecards around six resources of the church: prayer, people, time, 
finances, facilities, and technology. Here are a few ideas from each 
category to rethink outside the walls of the church.
30
Prayer
• Number of people being prayed for both inside and outside 
the church
• Number of people prayed with during the week by church 
members
• Number of prayer meetings conducted off church property
• Number of prayer answers reported back to the church
• Number of community leaders adopted and prayed for each 
week

78
• Number  of  prayer  walks  taken  in  the  community  or  
neighborhoods
• Number of prayer cards received from community prayer 
boxes
• Time spent in prayer in staff meetings for community needs
• Number of times each week school teachers are prayed for/
over
People
• Number of people engaged in financial planning
• Number of people growing in financial giving to kingdom 
causes
• Number of people engaged in daily spiritual formation
• Number of people pursuing an intentional learning agenda
• Number of people reporting increased friendships over time
• Number of people sent into trailer parks, apartments, retire-
ment centers
• Number of community ministries adopted by church groups 
or classes
• Number of people serving other people in some venue
• Number of people serving as mentors
• Number of people practicing an intentional blessing strategy
Time and Calendar
• Amount of time spent debriefing people engaged in commu-
nity service
• Time spent in mentoring people in the community beyond 
the church

79
• Number of hours people spent in direct ministry to community 
needs
• Amount of time spent in gatherings celebrating stories of 
community involvement
• Number of hours each week members opened their homes 
to others
• Hours each week spent supporting or ministering to single 
parents
• Amount of time staff spent developing relationships with 
community leaders
Finances
• Number of people reporting personal debt retirement
• Number  of  people  increasing  their  generosity  through            
charitable giving
• Number of people who have developed a personal budget
• Percent of church budget moving toward externally focused 
ministry
• Percent of church debt reduced to free up dollars for people 
investment
• Amount of money invested in microeconomic development
Facilities
• Number of schools using church facilities for activities
• Number  of  community  organizations  using  the  church  
facilities 
• Space devoted to conversation-friendly areas

80
• Use of church land for soccer or baseball fields, basketball 
court, or skateboard park
• Number of hours the facilities are used during the week by 
people for personal growth such as exercise classes, tutoring, 
and life skill seminars
Technology
• Number of podcast interviews with community leaders
• Space on church website dedicated to community events and 
engagement
• Number of webinars to educate people about missional 
opportunities
• Number of graphics or videos telling the stories of missional 
engagement by members
Not only does counting the right things give us a better indication of 
a church’s engagement in the community, and ultimately its impact, 
but it also illustrates to the congregation what is important. When we 
count the things suggested, people know what is valued and know 
the target for which they need to be aiming.
MEASURING
While all the suggestions can certainly help a church begin to move in 
the right direction, these questions are still activities. They are more 
about “inputs” rather than “outcomes.” Unfortunately, most often in 
the church world, we stop with inputs.
We must focus on measurables that are outcome-based. Outcome-
based measurables are primarily focused on change. If we can 
describe the change we desire to see or make, we can also have 
conversations about whether we are moving toward that change 

81
over time. Measuring relates not so much to what is but what could 
be. It is more about possibilities. The best questions associated with 
measuring ask both about change and about time. For example, we 
might ask, “How have the test scores changed over the past six months 
in the elementary school where the church provides tutors?”
In the context of the church, measuring is about determining trans-
formational change in both people and in the neighborhoods where 
we live. Ask, “What changes would you like to see in the lives of the 
people but also in the life of your community?” That is an outcome. 
But then ask the follow-up question, “What will it take to get to that 
place?” Then begin to ask measurement questions toward that change. 
“How will we know if we are making progress in the right direction?” 
“What will we measure to determine transformational change?” 
Measuring is definitely more difficult than counting, but it is essential 
if we are serious about making a difference. When something is 
measured and shows transformational change, it will be repeated 
and create a ripple effect. Rethinking scorecards will not only help 
create a more missional culture but people will also have a better 
idea of what is valued. 

82
CONCLUSION:      
THINK LONG HAUL,  
NOT QUICK FIX
As I noted in the introduction, the answer to the crises of the church 
in North America will not be found by making minor adjustments. 
Simply doing more of the same will not get us where we need to be in 
church multiplication. Instead, we must be willing to rethink deeply 
held assumptions about the nature of the church, mission, discipleship, 
and leadership. Without these needed paradigm shifts in the way 
we think, we will not be capable of making the necessary changes 
to activate all the people of God and engage His mission more fully.
The late Austrian philosopher, Ivan Illich, was once asked about the 
most revolutionary way to change society. He answered the question 
this way:
Neither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change 
a society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so 
persuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes 

83
the preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits 
of our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that 
even shines some light into our future so that we can take the 
next step. ... If you want to change a society, then you have to 
tell an alternative story.
31
The church needs to tell an alternative story. Yet, it will be one that 
will often run contrary to the story many evangelicals have been 
told. It is a story of being sent rather than being served. It is a story 
of incarnating into local contexts. It is a story of activating all the 
people of God, not just a few. It is a story of embracing the posture 
of a servant, rather than being in a place of power and privilege. I 
would argue that at least in part, the story is tied up in the realization 
and application of the principles laid out in this book.
However, for many these shifts will not come easy. Be patient. 
Remember  the  deeply  held  assumptions  we  have  discussed  
throughout this book are indeed deeply held. Seventeen hundred 
years of Christendom will not be extracted from your church quickly. 
Rethinking rarely happens overnight. Most people will need to visit 
and revisit these ideas. They will need to process with other people 
over time. In other words, a pastor can’t preach a 4-week sermon 
series and somehow think everyone in the congregation is going 
to magically “get it.”
Instead teach and talk about each of these principles, not just from 
the pulpit, but one-on-one and in small group settings. Perhaps walk 
through this book with a group of early adopters who intuitively know 
there must be an alternative story. A story where God is calling the 
body of Christ to join Him in the restoration of all things.
