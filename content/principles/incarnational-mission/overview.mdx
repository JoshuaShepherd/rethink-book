# Rethink Incarnational Mission

Incarnation means proximity and presence. Jesus moved into the neighborhood (John 1:14). Mission is not an event; it's a way of being with people.

Too often, we think of mission as something we _do_ rather than something we _are_. We organize events, run programs, and create initiatives—all good things—but we miss the fundamental posture that makes the gospel believable: **incarnational presence**.

## The Heart of Incarnation

When the Word became flesh and moved into the neighborhood, it wasn't just a theological statement. It was a missional strategy. Jesus didn't commute to earth; he relocated. He learned the local language, ate the local food, and walked the local streets.

This is our calling too: to embrace incarnational mission that prioritizes presence before proclamation, proximity before programs.

## What This Means Today

In our post-Christendom context, incarnational mission requires us to:

- **Move closer** rather than expecting others to come to us
- **Listen first** before we speak
- **Join existing good** instead of always starting something new
- **Seek the welfare of the city** as Jeremiah 29:4-7 teaches

This module will help you rethink what incarnational mission looks like in your everyday context, from your neighborhood to your workplace to your third places.
