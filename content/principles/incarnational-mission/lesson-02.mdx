# Practices of Presence

Moving from theology to practice, incarnational mission is embodied through consistent, simple practices that demonstrate God's love for a place and its people.

## The Ministry of Showing Up

Incarnational presence isn't complicated, but it is costly. It requires the sacrifice of convenience, the discipline of consistency, and the humility to receive before we give.

Consider these simple but profound practices:

### In Your Neighborhood

- **Eat with neighbors**: Share meals, not just small talk
- **Learn names**: Commit to knowing the people in your immediate proximity
- **Walk the block**: Regular presence creates natural opportunities for connection
- **Join existing good**: Look for what's already happening and how you can support it

### In Your Workplace

- **Be fully present**: Resist the urge to "get through" your work day
- **Celebrate others**: Notice and affirm the good work happening around you
- **Create space**: Offer your office, your lunch hour, your listening ear

### In Your Third Places

- **Become a regular**: Consistency creates relationship opportunities
- **Learn the rhythm**: Understand the natural patterns and customs
- **Offer your gifts**: Use your skills and resources to serve the common good

<Scripture ref="Jer 29:4-7">
  "Build houses and settle down; plant gardens and eat what they produce...
  Also, seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which I have carried you
  into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, because if it prospers, you too will
  prosper."
</Scripture>

## The Long View

Jeremiah 29:4-7 reveals God's heart for incarnational mission. God doesn't tell his people to survive until they can escape. He tells them to:

- **Settle down**: Commit to place, not just pass through it
- **Plant gardens**: Invest in the long-term flourishing of the community
- **Seek the city's welfare**: Work for the common good, not just your own benefit
- **Pray for the place**: Intercede for the flourishing of your context

## Obstacles to Presence

What keeps us from incarnational mission?

- **Suburbanization of the soul**: We commute through life rather than dwelling in it
- **Program-centered thinking**: We create events rather than enter rhythms
- **Success metrics**: We measure outcomes rather than faithfulness to presence
- **Cultural distance**: We maintain separation rather than embracing proximity

## The Fruit of Faithful Presence

When we commit to incarnational presence:

- Relationships deepen from acquaintance to friendship
- Trust builds through consistency and reliability
- Natural opportunities emerge for spiritual conversations
- The gospel becomes credible because it's been embodied
- Communities are strengthened by the presence of people who genuinely care

  **Remember**: You're not trying to get people to come to your church. You're
  trying to become the church where you are.

The goal isn't addition to your congregation. It's multiplication of God's presence in every sphere of life.
