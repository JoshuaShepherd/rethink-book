RETHINK FLOW
“If we fail at engaging well and living as Christ would live 
among our neighbors and friends, we fail as missionaries 
and the culture doesn’t see the visible beauty of the sent 
church.” —Hugh Halter 
Traditionally, we start with church then disciple people and send them 
on mission if we want to see multiplication. But, in a post-Christian 
context, we must start with discipleship and mission then work 
toward church. The most effective approach to multiplication is to 
begin with missionary activity.
This is what is meant by the phrase missionary flow. It’s a simple way 
to rethink the flow or direction of starting a new church. We need 
a new framework, a new way to think about planting that doesn’t 
begin with Sunday.

Let’s consider each circle individually.
 
ENGAGING CONTEXT
Too often church multiplication starts with Christians from another 
church or they gather disconnected believers from around a city. 
This is well-intentioned and might be better than nothing at all, but 
in most cases, this is simply starting a church with a church. This is 
not what we are talking about with missionary flow. Missionary flow 
means starting from scratch.
The first phase of any mission must involve contextualization, under-
standing the local setting so you can best engage people relationally. 
Along with understanding the context, we need to remember that 
we are a sent, missionary people. In other words, we have already 
been sent into our neighborhoods. We have already been sent to our 
workplaces. We have already been sent to the social spaces we inhabit 
each day. We don’t have to wait, wondering where God might send 
us. Instead, we already live, work, and play in these places for the 
purpose of God’s mission.
This is where our church multiplication efforts need to start. We must 
identify the places and people to whom God has sent us. Incarnate 
into those places. Pray and listen for what God is doing. Discern how

He wants us to participate as we begin to understand, relate to, and 
connect with people. Start with discipleship and mission and work 
toward church. 
CULTIVATING COMMUNITY
The word cultivating speaks to the idea of nurturing. When we culti-
vate soil, we prepare it for planting. We have no power to make crops 
grow, but we can nurture conditions that will increase the likelihood 
for growth. Cultivating community is similar. We can’t make commu-
nity happen, but we can create opportunities and environments in 
which community can flourish.
We use the word community to make a distinction from the more 
customary word church. Cultivating community involves creating 
time and space for people to connect relationally with you but also 
with each other. The key is that this space is not seen as a church 
but instead as a place where relationships are developed. When 
relationships begin to develop, you are building “social momentum.”
Examine the updated missionary flow and notice two additional 
phrases and arrows.

SOCIAL MOMENTUM
Social momentum creates spaces for Christians and non-Christians 
to connect, do life together, and build relational equity before they 
consider attending a church. Unless we create a consistent, gathering 
environment—between engaging context and structuring congre-
gation—that people can be invited to and be part of, we will never 
experience social momentum in our missionary engagement.
Here is another way to think about it. Most church planters are good 
at engaging context. They work at getting to know their neighbors. 
They are intentional about making connections in coffee shops or at 
the gym. They pay careful attention at their workplaces for oppor-
tunities to make friends with coworkers. However, if there isn’t an 
ongoing, somewhat informal “get-together” for the planter to invite 
people to, they will simply have lots of surface connections that never 
move beyond being acquaintances. After making connections with 
new people, many church planters don’t have a clear vision of what 
to do next relationally. Too often, the step taken is to start a Sunday 
morning worship service so there is a church activity to which new 
people can be invited.
Now, there is certainly nothing wrong with inviting people to church, 
but in a missionary context, we need to consider an intermediate or 
in-between relational step. There must be regular, relational spaces to 
which we can easily and naturally invite people. Without a consistent 
space to welcome the people we have met while engaging in our 
context, we will never develop social momentum. Instead, we will 
simply have relational connections that never move beyond knowing 
each other by name.
So, what do those relational spaces look like? We need to find some-
thing we are already doing, or at least like to do, and develop a 

72
consistent rhythm where we can easily invite someone to join. For 
example, maybe you have a fire pit in your backyard that you light 
every Saturday night. Maybe it is a game night once a week or once a 
month in your home. Schedule a neighborhood potluck once a month. 
Sharing meals is always a great idea.  
The point is that when you have an ongoing relational event, it is 
natural to invite those you are trying to connect with. You could say 
to a coworker or neighbor, “Hey, on the first Saturday night of every 
month, we have a group of friends over to roast hot dogs and make 
s’mores around the fire pit. You are always welcome to join us.”
Creating time and space to develop social momentum will provide a 
necessary opportunity for Christians and non-Christians to begin the 
process of cultivating community within a neighborhood or network.
SPIRITUAL MOMENTUM
Now, back to missionary flow. 
 
The new arrow coming out of cultivating community is spiritual 
momentum. Much like developing social momentum, we need to 
think about creating time and space but, in this case, to provide 
opportunities for people to grow spiritually.

It may be as simple as gathering to pray for one another, read through 
the Gospels, or discuss what Scripture says regarding current events. 
If we are truly doing life with unbelievers and developing social 
momentum, then there will be those who desire deeper, more mean-
ingful conversations. It should be natural and easy to say to someone 
that you have a group of friends that meet once a week to pray for 
each other and talk about spiritual things.
If we are starting with and connecting exclusively with non-Christians, 
the group that provides spiritual momentum may be something brand 
new. In other words, it may be formed directly out of the time and 
space created to develop social momentum. However, if we have a 
group of Christians who are a part of a church planting team, this 
spiritual momentum group may be a missional community to which 
we invite that person.
STRUCTURING CONGREGATION
The final circle is structuring congregation. There will come a time 
to form or structure a congregation. There will be many issues to 
consider, such as governance, meeting rhythms, administration, 
budgets, staffing, and so forth.
Don’t forget that we are talking about the importance of thinking like 
a missionary. Church multiplication is the outworking of mission and 
community. Structuring a congregation is the outworking of engaging 
context and cultivating community. Church multiplication is the point 
where mission and community intersect. At the heart of God’s plan 
to bless the nations are the people of God. The church is formed by 
mission and is formed for mission.
