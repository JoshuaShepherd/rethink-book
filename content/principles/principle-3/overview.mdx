# PRINCIPLE 3: INCARNATIONAL MISSION

## INCARNATIONAL MISSION

If God's central way of reaching His world was to incarnate Himself, then the church's mission should be incarnational as well.

The last two **missiological** principles we examined illuminated the
missionary nature of God and the “sentness” of the church. God is
a missionary God who sends a missionary church. However, being
sent is only part of the story. The language of “**incarnational** mission”
represents the rooting of our lives and the gospel into the place we
live. If the essence of **missional** living is sending, then the heart of
**incarnational** mission is staying.

## THE INCARNATION

The word incarnation comes from a Latin word that literally means
“in the flesh.” It refers to the act whereby God took on human flesh and
entered our world to bring about reconciliation between Himself and
humanity. The incarnation is God’s ultimate **missional** participation in
creation (John 3:16-17). When God entered our world in and through
the person of Jesus, He came to live among us. He **eskénosen**—literally,
“set up a tent.” In simpler terms, “The Word became flesh and blood,
and moved into the neighborhood” (John 1:14, MSG).

If God’s central way of reaching His world was to incarnate Himself
in Jesus, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be
**incarnational**. It is important to acknowledge that the incarnation
of Jesus was a special, unrepeatable event. Though we will never
be able to embody God the way Jesus does, we ought to be able to
make a distinction between the Incarnation with a capital “I” and
**incarnational** ministry.
Obviously, there is nothing wrong with inviting believers to model
their lives after the life of Jesus. The apostles encouraged Christians to
imitate Christ as a way of identifying with Him. Both Peter and Paul
insisted that Jesus is the model for Christian living. “To this you were
called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that
you should follow in his steps” (1 Peter 2:21). Peter makes clear that
Jesus’ life is to be our example. “Follow my example, as I follow the
example of Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). And Paul states that we can
follow his way of life because he is so closely following the way of Jesus.
Missiologist Michael Frost elaborates on the theme of following Christ’s
example from the book of Philippians:
Paul makes this point even more strongly in Philippians, in
which he tells us that our “attitude should be the same as
that of Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5). We often assume that
this passage then commends to us Jesus’ humility, which is
clearly present in the text. But Jesus’ humility is commended
to us insofar as it is expressed in his commitments to identi­
fication and relinquishment. First, to follow Jesus’ example
means that we should share his profoundly humble identifi­
cation with sinful humankind (Philippians 2:7b-8a). Second,
those of us who wish to emulate Jesus should be aware of
his equally humble willingness to empty himself and make
himself nothing for the sake of God’s redemptive purposes
(Philippians 2:6-7a). … To embrace an **incarnational** ministry,
then, involves a willingness to relinquish our own desires and
interests in the service of others.4
This examination of the Philippians speaks to two very important
ideas related to **incarnational** mission—the concepts of proximity
and presence.
**incarnational** mission involves living in close proximity with others.
We cannot love and serve those God has sent us to from a distance.
Jesus took on flesh and blood and moved into the neighborhood, so
we must do the same. This may require moving geographically to
be closer to those to whom God has sent us. At the very least, it will
demand creating time and space to be directly and actively involved
in the lives of people we are seeking to reach.
The concept of presence moves beyond mere proximity to identifica­
tion and surrender. Jesus identified with and advocated for those who
He was called to serve. As the Philippians passage makes clear, He
humbled Himself. He literally emptied Himself for the sake of others.
This realization reveals an **incarnational** approach that calls us to
relational identification with our neighbors, leading us to tangible
acts of love and sacrifice.
Jesus’ words from John 20:21 are most often used to emphasize the
sending of the disciples and subsequently the church, “As the Father
has sent me, I am sending you.” But we must not neglect the first half
of the passage. Jesus says, “As the Father has sent me …” (emphasis
added). The word “as” (or in some translations “just as”) translates
to “like” or “in a similar manner.” In other words, we need to be sent
like Jesus was sent. To whom and in what manner was Jesus sent?
He was sent to the down and outers of society. He was with and for
tax collectors, the oppressed, the poor, and the diseased. If Jesus is
our example, we are called to do likewise.
In The Incarnation and the Church’s _Witness_, Darrell Guder provides
an insightful summary on the incarnation of Jesus and what it means
to be a Christian.
We arrive at the concept of **incarnational** witness as one way
of expounding on the character of our missionary vocation. In
the incarnation of Jesus Christ, God revealed himself as the One
who is with and for his creation. Now, as the Risen Lord sends
his Spirit to empower the church, we are called to become
God’s people present in the world, with and for the world,
like St. John pointing always to Christ. The most **incarnational**
dimension of our witness is defined by the cross itself, as we
experience with Jesus that bearing his cross transforms our
suffering into witness.
**incarnational** witness is, therefore, a way of describing Chris­
tian vocation in terms of Jesus Christ as the messenger, the
message, and the model for all who follow after him. To speak
of the incarnation missionally is to link who Jesus was, what
Jesus did, and how he did it, in one great event that defines
all that it means to be Christian.5

What does all this talk of identification, proximity, and presence have
to do with daily living? It may sound cliché, but it really is all about
relationships. It’s all about getting close enough to people to listen,
understand their hopes and dreams, and coming to love them the
way Jesus does.
The Gospels tell us that Jesus is a friend of sinners. Hear that—a
friend. What constitutes a friend? When another person invites you
to meet their friends, you are in. The Bible is full of stories of people
inviting Jesus to meet and spend time with their friends. People were
drawn to the mysterious love and holiness of Jesus. Someone once
said that people who were not like Jesus liked Jesus. As followers of
Jesus, shouldn’t that also be true of us? That doesn’t happen without
living with and among people. What will it take for you to incarnate
the life of Jesus? What will it take for you to really move into your
neighborhood, perhaps for the very first time?

A fascinating passage in the Old Testament provides a picture of
what it looks like to live out **incarnational** mission. It gives practical
instructions for digging into the places where we live. This is espe­
cially helpful when Christians sense they are living in a world that
is hostile toward their beliefs or living in a place that doesn’t really
feel like home.
In Jeremiah, we read how the nation of Israel had forsaken God’s
law and found themselves taken into captivity, exiled far from their
Jerusalem homeland. God sent the Babylonian empire to discipline
His people. As they were relocated to a foreign, idolatrous land, they
heard whispers that their time in the hostile country would be short.
False prophets began telling the nation of Israel that God would soon
deliver them and settling into this new, strange land was foolish.
God’s word through the prophet Jeremiah was quite the opposite.
Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles
whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build
houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your
sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear
sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But
seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile,
and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will
find your welfare (Jeremiah 29:4-7, ESV).
The words of Jeremiah were shocking. The premise of his message
was that the exiles would be in Babylon for several generations and
that the Israelites would simply need to come to terms with this fact.
God was telling them to settle down and get used to being in this
hostile, ungodly place.
Jeremiah counseled his community not to be nostalgic for the past,
for the past could not be recovered. He did not advise them to plan
for insurrection, for there was no promise of their restoration in Jeru­
salem, at least not any time soon. Nor was the community’s survival
tied to the remnant that remained in Jerusalem (Jeremiah 24:5-10).
For Jeremiah, exile did not mean that God had abandoned Israel.
Rather, exile was the place where God was at work. God’s purposes
for Israel were served by the Babylonian invasion.
Jeremiah’s instructions were more counterintuitive than they might
at first seem. He tells the Jews to “seek the welfare” of their captors
and pray for the very people who destroyed their homeland, because
the welfare of the exiles and the captors were bound together. If God’s
purposes for Israel were being fulfilled through their captivity, then
as the exiles pursued the shalom of Babylon, God would provide
shalom for those in exile.6
It seemed reasonable for the Jews to be hostile to their captors. It
also would have been natural for them to withdraw from the world
around them. By the same token, it would have been easy for them
to simply assimilate into the Babylonian culture. Any of these options
would have made sense in human terms. But God called the Israelites
to something radically different, not to be defensive against, isolated
from, or absorbed into the dominant culture but instead to be incar­
nated within it.7 He was calling them to dig into the place He had sent
them, to stay where they would be doing life for a long time.
What God instructed the exiles to do is rather ordinary. Consider the
list from Jeremiah 29:
• Build houses and live in them.
• Plant gardens and eat their produce.
• Have children.
• Marry off your children so they have children.
• Seek the welfare of the city.
• Pray for the welfare of the city.
Nothing from this list is dramatic or miraculous. These are normal,
everyday activities. It could represent any person, regardless of
income, social status, education, vocation, or geographical location.
The way the kingdom of God takes root in the lives of people and
ultimately changes a city is by exiles living normal, everyday lives as
citizens of the King in every neighborhood and city. We build houses.
We plant gardens. We have children. We seek the welfare of our city.
Often, the ways of Jesus are indeed local and ordinary.
Are you willing to commit to the welfare of your city? Will you allow
your imagination to see a movement that begins with the local and
ordinary but over time becomes global and extraordinary? If your
answer is yes, then together let’s seek the welfare of our neighbor­
hoods and let us strive for it to spill over into every nook and cranny
of our city.
