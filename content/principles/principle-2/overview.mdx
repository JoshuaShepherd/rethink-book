RETHINK THE          
MISSIONARY NATURE 
OF THE CHURCH
“Following Jesus into the mission field is either impossible 
or extremely difficult for the vast majority of congrega-
tions in the Western world because of one thing: They 
have a systems story that will not allow them to take the 
first step out of the institution into the mission field, even 
though the mission field is just outside the door of the 
congregation.” —Bill Easum
Now that we have discussed the missionary nature of God, why is it 
important for us to recapture God’s missionary nature in the grand 
narrative of Scripture? Why should we consider God as a missionary 
God by examining sending language in the Bible? If God is a missionary 
God (and He is!), then we as His people are missionary people. The 
nature and essence of the church is rooted in the missionary nature 

13
of God. Another way to articulate this truth is to say that the church 
doesn’t just send missionaries; the church is the missionary. 
Individually and collectively as the body of Christ, we are a sent, 
missionary church. We should be sending people in the church out 
among people of the world rather than attempting to attract people 
of the world in among people of the church. The reason we start with 
this crucial distinction is because most people in the church today 
do not think of their congregation in a sending, missionary manner.
REFORMATION HERITAGE VIEW 
People today understand the church in two prominent ways. The first 
view is what some call the “Reformation heritage” perspective.

 The 
main idea behind this understanding of the church is that Protestants 
have inherited a particular view of church from the Reformers, which 
emphasizes the right preaching of the Word, the right administration 
of the ordinances, and the proper exercise of church discipline. 
Historically these have been referred to as the “marks” of the church. 
While each of the three marks are important aspects of church life, this 
view has left us with an understanding of the church as a place where 
certain things happen. In other words, a person goes to church to 
hear the Bible taught, to participate in the Lord’s Supper and baptism, 
and, in some cases, to experience church discipline. Once again, all 
very good things, but is that the way we want to define the church? 
Do these marks speak to the real essence and nature of the church? 
CONTEMPORARY VARIATION VIEW
The second view is a slight variation on the Reformation heritage defi-
nition. The contemporary variation view is perhaps the most prevalent 
way people in North America understand the church today, as a vendor 
of religious goods and services. From this perspective, members are 

14
viewed more as customers for whom religious goods and services are 
produced. Churchgoers expect the church to provide a wide range of 
religious services, such as great worship music, preaching, children’s 
programs, small groups, parenting seminars, and so forth. 
One of the key issues with both views of defining the church is that 
the church is seen as an institution that exists for the benefit of its 
members.
The church should not be viewed as a place where certain marks must 
occur or as a consumer interaction that provides services. The nature 
of the church—rooted in the very nature of God—is missionary. The 
church is a people called and sent by God to participate in His redemp-
tive mission in the world. Rather than seeing ourselves primarily as 
a sending body, we must see ourselves as a body that is sent. 
Of course, the church still gathers, but the difference is that we don’t 
simply gather for our own sake, but for the sake of others, or better 
yet, for the sake of God’s mission. We come together as a collective 
body to be equipped through prayer, worship, and study to then be 
sent out into the world. The church is meant to be a gathered and 
scattered people. 
Missionary Lesslie Newbigin stated it this way, “The church is not 
meant to call men and women out of the world into a safe religious 
enclave but to call them out in order to send them back as agents of 
God’s kingship.”
WHY THIS MATTERS
To grasp the importance of understanding the church as missionary, 
consider the idea of cultural distance. This is a simple missionary 
tool to help discern just how far a person or a people group is from a

meaningful engagement with the gospel. This image provides a visual. 
Notice the number scale. Each numeral with the prefix m indicates 
a significant cultural barrier to the meaningful communication of 
the gospel. Barriers include such things as language, race, history, 
worldview, traditions, beliefs, political affiliation, and so forth. The 
greater the number of cultural barriers, the increased complexity 
there will be in communicating with another person.
In The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church, Alan Hirsch 
offers a description of how the scale might look in a local context.
• m0–m1: People in this group have some concept of Christianity. 
They would speak the same language, have similar interests, 
are probably the same nationality, and are from a similar 
class grouping. Most of your friends would probably fit into 
this group.
• m1–m2: This group includes the average non-Christian, 
someone who has little awareness of or interest in Christianity 
and is somewhat suspicious of the church. This category might 
also include those previously offended by a bad experience 
of church or Christians.
• m2–m3: People in this group have no idea about Christianity 
or might be part of an ethnic group with different religious 
impulses or a fringe subculture. This group will include people 
antagonistic toward Christianity as they understand or have 
experienced it.

m0m1m2m3m4
• m3–m4: This group might be inhabited by ethnic and religious 
groupings such as Muslims or Jews. The fact that they are in 
the West might ameliorate some of the distance, but just about 
everything else gets in the way of a meaningful dialogue. They 
are resistant to the gospel.

This discussion is important because churches in North America often 
operate almost exclusively in the sphere of m0–m1, as illustrated in 
this image.
Many churches in North America function in a sort of Christian 
bubble where there are little or no cultural barriers. This problem is 
significant because, as we have stated previously, it is we who are the 
called, sent, missionary people of God, which will sometimes mean we 
must go to where people are. If we fail to go to the people, the only way 
they will encounter the gospel meaningfully is by coming to us. This 
is the built-in assumption of the attractional church, and it requires 
the nonbeliever do the cross-cultural work to find Jesus, and not us! 
And make no mistake, for many people, coming to a church service 
involves serious cross-cultural work. When we ask them to come to 
us, we are in essence asking them to be the missionaries.
Instead, we must see that we are missionary people, sent to participate 
with a missionary God, who desires to reconcile all of creation to 
Himself for His glory. We, the church, are called to bless and reach 
the nations.
