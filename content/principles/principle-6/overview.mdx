# PRINCIPLE 6: RETHINK PLACE

“To be a stranger in a strange land, to be lost ... is per­
haps the condition most typical of contemporary life.”
> —Iain Chambers
The film Avalon is a story of an extended family who arrives in America
in the early 1900s. Avalon is the name of the neighborhood where
the family members settled. The first half of the film highlights the
integration of the extended family. Life in Avalon is lived with others
and rooted not only in relationships but also in place.
However, halfway through the film, three themes fragment the family:
suburbs, automobiles, and televisions. The rise of suburbs creates
physical distance between extended family members. The afford­
ability of automobiles enables the families to live in the suburbs, but
the fathers then spend less time at home as they commute to their
jobs. And the popularity of television leads to dinners in front of a
screen instead of conversations around a table. The film ends with
the resulting alienation and isolation of the extended family.17
The Great Good Place by Ray Oldenburg highlights similarities I noticed
in Avalon. Oldenburg contends that most communities in the United
States are void of relational vitality, primarily because of the loss of
what he calls informal public places. He understands the absence
of informal public life as the result of suburban sprawl and the rise
of the automobile culture, both of which foster geographical and
relational separation between home and workplace. The problem
is magnified by home entertainment that often inhibits face-to-face
communication. Today, this issue has moved far beyond the intro­
duction of television as portrayed in Avalon. Smartphones, computers,
tablets, gaming devices, and streaming services provide limitless
viewing options.
The warning that Oldenburg sounded over 30 years ago remains
relevant today:
The problem of place in America manifests itself in a sorely defi­
cient informal public life. The structure of shared experience
beyond that offered by family, job, and passive consumerism is
small and dwindling. The essential group experience is being
replaced by the exaggerated self-consciousness of individuals.
American life-styles, for all the material acquisition and the
seeking after comforts and pleasures, are plagued by boredom,
loneliness, alienation, and a high price tag. America can point
to many areas where she has made progress, but in the area
of informal public life she has lost ground and continues to
lose it.18

The way of life in developed countries is greatly reducing the quan­
tity and quality of our relationships. Most people no longer live in
extended families or even near each other. When you add the high
degree of mobility, a strong sense of individualism, and decreased
opportunities for informal public life, isolation and loneliness become
increasingly common.
While studies show that we are now actually “connected” to a larger
and more diverse circle of people, nearly a quarter of Americans say
they have nobody to talk to. In 1985, that figure was 8 percent.19 And
this is not simply a picture of solitary retirees. Middle-aged people
are the loneliest group in the United States. According to one study,
40 percent of adults ages 45–49 said they were lonely, up from 20
percent in the 1980s.20
The issue of isolation is compounded by a sense of detachment from
place. In a highly mobile society, people rarely feel rooted geographi­
cally. We live as nomads, both figuratively and literally. But God created
us as social, relational beings. We are created to be in a relationship
with the Creator but also to be in relationships with other people.
We have been formed with an innate need to know and be known.

What then is the appropriate response to a culture of increasing
displacement? Can something turn the tide of isolation? What practical
actions can be taken to mend the broken pieces? To restore people
and places to flourish?
The solution is no doubt multifaceted. It will involve a variety of
tactics: engaging with our neighbors, restoring genuine community,
sharing meals with others, welcoming strangers, and opening our
lives to those who are disconnected. But in all of the practical actions,
the how must be rooted in the why of **incarnational** presence. The
journey of restoring the relational fabric of our communities must
begin with our tangible presence in the place where God has called us.
