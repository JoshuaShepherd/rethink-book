RETHINK STRATEGIES 
AND MODELS
“No strategy will reach every kind of person except 
a  strategy  that  mobilizes  every  kind  of  person.”                   
—Brian Sanders 
Church multiplication and church planting take many different 
forms; therefore, defining the models is a difficult task. However, 
as we discuss how to rethink church multiplication, here are four 
approaches in the church planting landscape.  
• Contemporary attractional or launch
• Missional communities or microchurches
• Campus or multisite
• Replant 

60
CONTEMPORARY ATTRACTIONAL    
OR LAUNCH
In a contemporary attractional or launch model, a church planter 
begins with a launch team. In some cases, the church plant may 
even begin with a small staff. This model seeks to build a core group, 
usually 30–50 people, which will become their launch team. Often 
there is a “sending church” that is large enough to send the people 
that make up the initial team. 
Once a launch team is formed, the church will conduct a series of 
preview services to give the target community a picture of what 
the church will be like before it goes public. In some cases, a church 
plant may refer to this as a “soft launch,” where the core group holds 
corporate gatherings that are less publicized to increase the size of the 
launch team and build momentum. At the time of the “hard” launch, 
the church will send out a mass-mailer or other marketing to invite 
the community to attend the new church.
Because much of church planting over the past four decades has been 
focused in suburban areas populated by middle to upper class families, 
the launch model has been effective. However, it has lost some of its 
effectiveness in areas saturated by other contemporary churches. And 
as North America is increasingly becoming a missionary context, the 
percentage of people open to this kind of church plant is declining.
ADVANTAGES 
Launching large breaks growth barriers. Begin small, and chances 
are the church will remain small. But start large, and the church will 
break growth barriers quicker. One effective way to shatter growth 
barriers is with momentum created by launching large. Momentum is 
one of a planter’s best tools for growth. Launching large can produce 
tremendous momentum.

61
Launching large provides credibility. When a first-time guest walks into 
a new church and sees a large crowd, they immediately sense that 
something good is happening, and the credibility of the church increases.
Launching large facilitates financial sustainability. By launching with 
a large group, the church may be able to quickly become financially 
sustainable. Learning to effectively raise funds and creating a well 
planned budget for a new church are foundational for launching 
large and becoming self-sustaining within a couple of years.
POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES
Launching large has a higher cost. On the flip side of becoming finan-
cially sustainable faster, it costs more to launch a large church. Further, 
many expenses will be up front, including rent for a meeting space, 
sound system and video equipment, computers, musical instruments, 
and supplies for children’s ministry. Marketing for the launch is 
another significant financial commitment.
Launching large can be stressful. Beginning with a church of 100 or 
more people will create challenges with assimilation, programming, 
and development. Because of the potential to start with a large 
group, the planting team will need systems in place prior to the first 
public service. Rather than simply going through a worship service, 
plans will have to be made for children, parking, group space, and 
so forth before the church opens its doors. This can be stressful and 
time-consuming.
MISSIONAL COMMUNITIES             
OR MICROCHURCHES
Proponents of a missional community or microchurch model propose 
that when starting a new church, you should begin with missionary 
activity and not with the corporate gathering. Church planting over 

62
the past several decades has really focused on a church service. When 
the emphasis is on the large gathering, we can lose focus on what God 
is doing in the surrounding context. Further, because many people 
today are less interested in the programs and activities of the church, 
starting a church by attempting to attract people to attend a corporate 
gathering may prove to be difficult. 
WHAT IS A MISSIONAL COMMUNITY?
Missional communities are not smaller church services, Bible studies, 
small groups, or other programs of the church. Instead, missional 
communities are the church. Those who follow this model will gather 
their missional communities into a corporate setting once there are 
three or more communities. They may meet once a month then choose 
to gather on a weekly basis.
Many have been so conditioned by what they have experienced through 
typical church activities that they naturally seek to make missional 
communities fit what they have known before. Other programs and 
activities of the church are great for the purposes they serve, but they 
do not generally deliver on the purposes of missional communities.
A missional community is a committed group of Jesus followers, the 
size of an extended family (12–25 people), and empowered by the 
Spirit to participate in God’s mission of redemption in a particular 
neighborhood and/or network. Hopefully, this definition offers a 
framework to differentiate a missional community from a traditional 
small group. It is important as you define what a missional commu-
nity looks like in your context that you are not too prescriptive. In 
other words, allow each missional community to be unique to their 
context and mission. All missional communities will not, and should 
not, look alike. 

63
MICROCHURCHES
While microchurches share several characteristics with missional 
communities, there are a couple differences. Like missional communities, 
microchurches see mission as the organizing principle of their existence. 
However, microchurches not only focus on specific neighborhoods 
and networks of relationships but engage in specific problems. These 
areas of missional engagement could include poverty issues, human 
trafficking, education, crime, homelessness, mental health, and other 
areas of brokenness where gospel restoration is needed.
The language of microchurch provides a broader umbrella to encom-
pass a variety of church expressions. How and where microchurches 
gather and engage their missional contexts will be different. Some 
will meet in their homes, as that approach often makes sense for 
reaching a neighborhood or a social network. Others will meet 
in coffee shops, cafés, community centers, apartment complexes, 
and the like. 
Like missional communities, microchurches will not, and should 
not, look alike. Perhaps the greatest distinction between a missional 
community and a microchurch is that microchurches are seen as 
the church in its smallest, most nimble, and potent expression. Most 
missional communities are closely “tethered” to the larger church. 
Missional communities are seen by many as an outreach expression 
of the church. 
Microchurches, on the other hand, give special emphasis to empow-
ering people to use their gifts and resources to engage in God’s redemp-
tive mission. They provide an opportunity for localized leaders to 
create and contextualize expressions of the church. They give both 
the license to lead and creative control. This does not negate the 
benefits of networking microchurches together for the sake of training, 

64
coaching, accountability, and movement. However, those resources 
exist to support the microchurches, not for the microchurches to 
support the network.
ADVANTAGES
• They are highly relational. Both missional communities and 
microchurches network and build bridges throughout the 
community, including neighborhoods, businesses, schools, 
non-profits, local government, and so forth.
• They disciple their way into church planting. By loving and 
serving people through a growing network of relationships, 
a missional community or microchurch will create space for 
people to belong before they believe. In this space discipleship 
happens, which in turn leads to the multiplication of churches, 
not the other way around.
• They are a better fit for certain contexts. A missional commu-
nity or microchurch approach is more conducive in urban 
contexts, along with places where meeting space is limited 
or expensive. The relational aspect is also more fruitful in 
post-Christian environments.
POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES
• Slower growth. The nature of a relational, disciple-making 
approach inherently leads to slower growth. A church planter 
that  employs  this  model  needs  to  have  a  long  “runway”  
perspective. 
• Financial stability. Because of the grassroots nature of this 
approach, the church plant may not experience financial 
sustainability for several years. However, because bivocational 
or covocational leadership best fits this model, the church plant 
may be in a position to focus on steady, long-term growth.

65
CAMPUS OR MULTISITE 
Many churches find the campus or multisite model, compared to 
building larger facilities, more fiscally wise and sustainable.
ADVANTAGES
• They are well resourced. Multisite churches are usually well 
resourced—fiscally, organizationally, structurally, and profes-
sionally—because they are connected to a main campus. This 
connection strengthens the foundation of the new campus. 
Multisite and satellite campuses can also be a great incubator 
for developing emerging leaders.
• They are an effective way for an existing church to extend their 
reach. Churches who implement a multisite model can extend 
their mission and vision to a different geographical area. In 
many cases, the campus is an area that already has people 
who attend the main campus. The church can start with a 
built-in launch team that understands the church’s vision, 
mission, and strategy. Many multisite churches embrace the 
motto, “One church in multiple locations.” 
POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES
• They can be personality driven. One drawback is that multisite 
campuses can be built around a single personality, especially 
if the lead teaching pastor is the same for all campuses. When 
the church is built upon one personality, the church can suffer 
when that person is no longer there.
• They can lack contextualization. Another drawback is that 
this model can create “cookie cutter” churches that are not 
properly contextualized. When an existing church’s vision 
and mission is “imported” in a different geographical context, 

66
it may not be a good fit for that location. Just because a church 
model and strategy are successful in one setting doesn’t guar-
antee it will be effective in another.
REPLANT
The replant process involves the decision to close an existing church 
and relaunch as a new church, with new leadership, a new name, 
new governance, and a new ministry approach. In this model, a 
dying church avoids permanent death by recognizing it will no longer 
flourish unless conditions drastically change to facilitate growth.
ADVANTAGES
• Builds on the history or legacy of the previous church. This may 
help those who would prefer the status quo and recognizes 
the church’s past impact in the community.
• A new identity creates momentum. Establishing a new identity 
in the community can create momentum, enthusiasm, and 
interest in the replant.
• Offers a break with the past and a fresh start for the future. Setting 
an end date and a launch date avoids permanent death of 
the church.  
POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES
• Requires a new leader and a decision-making structure.  To  
replant, a new leader and new structure and approach for 
making decisions must be in place. 
• Those in power may reject the new leadership structure. A new 
leadership structure is sometimes rejected by those in power. 
• Patience is essential. The average turnaround time for a replant 
is 5–7 years, so patience is key.

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
Learn and implement the strengths of different models. There are 
strengths and challenges of every model. While you may operate 
from one model, it is helpful to incorporate the strengths from other 
models. Perhaps in your context you should consider a hybrid that 
takes the best of multiple models and implements them to suit your 
needs for multiplication.
Pick a model that fits who you are and where you are. Do not import 
a model from another leader or context. When considering church 
multiplication, leaders are often guilty of attending a conference or 
visiting another church and concluding that they want to plant the 
church they have seen or heard about in their context. But resist the 
temptation to import a model from outside your context. Pick a model 
that fits your giftedness and your context.
Remember the model is just a tool, not the target. We live in a highly 
pragmatic culture and want to know what works. We want to utilize 
the products or approaches that produce the best results. But the 
models are simply tools. Don’t put your faith in them to produce 
results only God can produce. Instead, focus your faith on the calling 
that God has put on your life for a particular place and people group.
