# PRINCIPLE 5: POST-Christendom

“In ******Christendom**** the emphasis was on maintaining a
supposedly Christian status quo, but in post-****Christendom****
it is on mission within a contested environment.”
> —Stuart Murray
Remember the famous line from The Wizard of Oz, when Dorothy
first arrives in Oz and realizes she is now in a world that is strangely
different? “Toto,” she says to her little dog, “I’ve a feeling we’re not in
Kansas anymore.” Dorothy’s surroundings were suddenly unfamiliar.
The people and places she was used to seeing no longer existed. She
had no idea where she was, but one thing was certain—everything
around her had drastically changed.13
A place that is strangely different describes the world around the
church today. Culture has seemingly changed so quickly and radically
that many churches feel like exiles in a foreign land. Like Dorothy,
many churches no longer recognize their surroundings. They don’t
completely understand the changes that have taken place. They only
know that things are not like they used to be.

Numerous factors have influenced the change we see in Western
culture. Issues such as globalization, urbanization, post-modernism,
and the rise of the information age have significantly influenced the
church. However, nothing has shaken the foundations of the church
over the centuries as much as the rise and fall of ****Christendom****.
In 313 A. D., the Roman Emperor Constantine adopted the Christian
faith as his own and decided to replace paganism with Christianity
as the official imperial religion. He brought the church in from the
margins of society, where it had been operating for the previous three
centuries and united it with the empire. By giving great resources and
favors to the church, Constantine set in motion a process that would
eventually bring all of Europe into a church-state relationship known
as ****Christendom****. It is difficult to overstate the impact Constantine’s
decision had on the Christian faith. A few of the changes that took
place included:
•	 The assumption that all citizens were Christian by birth
•	 Infant baptism as the symbol of necessary incorporation into
the Christian society
•	 Sunday as the required day of church attendance, with penal­
ties for noncompliance
•	 The definition of “orthodoxy” as the common belief shared
by all, determined by powerful church leaders supported by
the state
•	 The construction of massive and ornate church buildings
•	 A strong distinction between clergy and laity and the relega­
tion of the laity to a largely passive role
•	 The increased wealth of the church and the obligation of
required tithes to fund the system
•	 The division of the globe into either “****Christendom****” or
“heathendom” and the waging of war in the name of Christ
and the church
•	 The use of political and military force to impose the Christian
faith14
The net effect of ****Christendom**** was that Christianity moved from being
a dynamic, revolutionary, social, and spiritual movement to being a
static religious institution with corresponding structures, priesthood,
and rituals. The Christian faith moved from an integrated way of life
that was lived out seven days a week to an obligation that was fulfilled
by attending a service at a set time.
By the middle of the 20th century, however, it was becoming clear
in Europe that ****Christendom**** was in serious decline. People began
to use the term “post-****Christendom****” to describe the church’s loss of
social privilege. Others used it to refer to Western civilizations that
no longer considered themselves to be Christian.
In the era of post-****Christendom****, the church returned to the margins
of society, losing prominence and control. While once the majority,
the church became the minority. The shift from once being on the
margins of society, elevated to a place of control, then back again to
the margins is illustrated in this image.15
Before Constantine, the dominant influence in society was the Roman
Empire and the church was a marginalized sect, located on the
outskirts. However, while the church operated on the margins, we
know from Paul’s Epistles and early church history that the church
was making serious inroads into the Roman Empire. The second circle
represents ****Christendom**** when the church became the dominant seat
of culture, albeit corrupted with political and military power. Today,
the picture is of a church that has been relegated back to the margins.
However, it is important to note that while those outside the church
understood that ****Christendom**** was fading, many inside the church
struggled to realize the church was losing its footing. Consequently, the
church was at a loss as to how to reach into the changing pluralistic,
postmodern culture that had little interest in it.

The difficulty the church is experiencing today in trying to relate to
culture is in large part due to our ****Christendom**** heritage. Many in the
church still believe that Christianity is in a place of influence and
significance and operate under the false assumption that ****Christendom****
is alive and well. While there may be some parts of the country that
still cling to Christian values, most of the population is rapidly moving

away from the things associated with the church. In the eyes of many
outside the church, the church has become completely irrelevant.
The decline of Christian influence in North America can be seen in
multiple ways. The most prominent is the continual drop in church
attendance. But it doesn’t end there. In fact, every indicator that can
be used to measure church health is headed in the wrong direction.
Conversions. Baptisms. Membership. Retention. Participation. Giving.
Religious literacy. Effects on the culture. Look at it from any direction.
Everything is in decline.16
This is an enormous problem. While the church is less effective at
reaching a changing world, many in the church continue to believe
that it maintains a central role in culture. Instead of leaning toward
the missionary vision of the church, we default to church as a place
where certain things happen and wrongly assume that those outside
the church will be interested in what we do. But every statistic proves
that simply isn’t the case.
Like Dorothy arriving in Oz, we must not forget that the religious
landscape around us has drastically changed. We are in a new land.
At times we may feel like exiles. But unlike many exiles, let us not
yearn for what once was. Instead, let us seek to bring life and vitality
to the land where God has placed us. Let us pray and toil for God’s
kingdom to come to the cities and neighborhoods in which we live.
This may be a hard pill to swallow, but the reality is that North America
is not a Christian place. Like Dorothy, we’re not in Kansas anymore!
The sooner we can come to grips with that reality, the sooner we can
return to the revolutionary, **missional** movement exemplified for us
in the early church.
