# PRINCIPLE 7: RETHINK VOCATION

“Believers participate in Christ’s priesthood not within the
walls of the Church but in the daily business of the world.”

> —Lesslie Newbigin
> Consider for a moment what you did yesterday. How much of your
> day was spiritual and how much was secular?
> Does selling insurance, running a coffee shop, driving for Uber, teaching
> at a public school, or waiting tables at the local restaurant matter to God?
> Most people would probably answer, “No, not much.” Yet, Christians
> may spend more than half of their lives in work-related activities.
> Rethinking vocation must start with a consideration of the sacred and
> secular divide. Greco-Roman thought was that the world is divided
> into two competing domains: the sacred or spiritual and the secular
> or material. Such a worldview tends to assume that the spiritual is the
> higher realm and that the material world lacks deep meaning. This

> clergy (spiritual) and the laity (secular), the church (spiritual) and the
> world (secular), and between so-called spiritual practices (Bible study,
> prayer, worship) and so-called secular practices (work, art, eating).
> This approach happens often in our understanding of vocation. The

> was given to secular things and regarded as a lower calling. This kind
> of thinking created a distorted view of work that continues today.
> For example, the language of “full-time Christian work” or “full-time

Often the language of bivocational invokes the thought of two distinct
vocations. To help us reconnect the two, we might use the language
of “covocation.” The prefix “co” is the reduced form of the Latin com
which means “together” or “in common.” English words like cofounder,
copilot, or companion are examples of words that denote partnership
and equality.
Covocation embodies the reality that if a person is called to be a
dentist, teacher, web-designer, or plumber and also called to start
a church, the different callings are not isolated from one another.
Instead, they are interlinked and equal. The language of covocation
pushes against the temptation to compartmentalize different aspects
of our lives. When we begin to understand that each of our callings
are legitimate and necessary aspects of God’s mission, they can be
leveraged together for His purposes.
Perhaps the most significant benefit of being bivocational or covoca­
tional is that it provides the planter greater opportunities to connect
relationally with people in the community. Some people have referred
to this as “marketplace mission” because relationships develop as a
result of the planter’s vocational connections. Their marketplace job
is not a hindrance to what God is doing but an advantage to engaging
God’s mission.
Being bivocational or covocational gives planters access to a mission
field that is not readily available to a pastor who is employed full-time
by a local church. Many of these pastors find themselves working
inside a church bubble, spending most of their time talking with
church people about church things. Even when a pastor makes
the effort to engage people in their community, they often find it
challenging to fully relate. It is not until a person incarnates into the
local context that they begin to understand the values and interests
of the people in their community.
Bivocational or covocational ministry also helps to diminish the sacred
and secular divide with respect to vocation. The congregation can see
the planter model the truth that all vocations are sacred. Whatever
work God has called a person to do, it is a sacred calling. As a result, the
benefits of being in the marketplace are multiplied exponentially as
every member recognizes how their vocation fits into God’s mission.
Another **missional** benefit is that working in an occupation in the
community builds credibility with those outside the church. In a
post-Christian context, where people are skeptical of the church, it
is important for non-Christians to see that church planters have jobs
like everyone else. In a time when Christianity doesn’t have the best
reputation, it can provide significant “street-cred” with those outside
the church.

Another major benefit of bivocational or covocational ministry relates
to the financial stability it provides in at least three different areas.

# 1. THE PLANTER

When the primary financial support comes from a marketplace
source rather than the church, there is usually less financial strain
on a family. This is especially true when the planter is employed
full-time in a vocation that provides benefits like insurance, vacation,
and retirement.

# 2. THE CHURCH

A church led by bivocational or covocational planters usually finds
its financial base is much stronger. Without the need to provide full-
time salaries and benefits, the church can put more of its financial
resources into ministry.

# 3. THE CHURCH PLANTING ENTITY

Many denominations plan to plant hundreds, if not thousands, of
churches over the next several years. Bivocational and covocational
ministry provides the opportunity for funding entities to embrace more
sustainable church **multiplication** practices. This is especially necessary
for planters who are engaging in socioeconomically diverse contexts.
Many traditional church plants start with a large annual budget
supported by multiple funding streams, including partnering
churches and denominational entities. Because most funding models
are structured over 3–5 years, it puts pressure on the planter to grow
the church quickly so it can become self-sustaining before funding
runs out. The unfortunate reality is that a planter is often forced to
attract financial givers rather than engaging in the brokenness in
their community. Bivocational or covocational ministry provides a
more viable financial model that allows the planter to focus primarily
on mission.
This move towards planting more churches with bivocational or
covocational planters must start by rethinking vocation. We need
to help people see that regardless of what God has called them to
do in the marketplace, their work matters and can align with God’s
redemptive purposes.
