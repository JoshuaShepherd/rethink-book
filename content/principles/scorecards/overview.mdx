INTRODUCTION 
“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who 
cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn,       
unlearn, and relearn.” —Alvin Toffler 
When bringing about change in the way people behave, we often 
need to start with questions of “why” before considering the practical 
issues of “how.” In the book Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire 
Everyone to Take Action, Simon Sinek contends that there are two 
primary ways to influence human behavior: you can either manip-
ulate it or inspire it. While manipulation is not always negative, for 
example when a retailer drops the price of a product to motivate a 
purchase, it often involves the use of fear or peer pressure to influ-
ence behavior. Additionally, change that is manipulated is usually 
short-lived. 
Inspiring change, on the other hand, involves the consideration of 
deeper issues. We need to ask underlying questions of “why.” Why 
do we perceive things in a particular way? Why do we behave in a 
certain manner? What are the motivations or inherent factors that 
undergird our behaviors? 
Ronald  Heifetz  deals  with  similar  issues  of  change  in  Leadership 
Without Easy Answers, making a distinction between organizational 

6
change and cultural change. He argues that organizational change 
typically involves restructuring, along with the use of new programs, 
processes, and techniques. Cultural change, however, looks at how 
to create a new culture or environment, which will require a new 
set  of  skills  and  capacities.  By  connecting  the  themes  of  these  two  
books,  we  can  say  that  cultural  change  is  about  starting  with  the  
“why,” while organizational change is more about the practical issues 
of “how.”
This topic of change is important in church multiplication because 
responses to the crises of the church in North America will not be 
organizational changes. We can’t settle with minor adjustments in 
our ecclesiology, how we do church. The problem is deeply rooted. 
We must rethink to make cultural changes and ask the “why” ques-
tions.  The  underlying  issues  are  primarily  spiritual,  theological,  
and  missiological.  If  we  want  to  plant  disciple-making,  missional  
churches  that  have  a  mindset  of  multiplication,  it  will  take  deep  
cultural change in the way we think about God’s mission and the 
nature of the church, as well as how the church lives out that mis-
sion in local contexts. We must change our attitude from “we have 
never done it that way before” to “whatever it takes.” 
Another  way  to  frame  the  rethinking  discussion  is  by  using  the  
language  of  paradigm.  The  word  paradigm  commonly  refers  to  a  
perception, assumption, or frame of reference. In a general sense, 
it’s  how  we  see  the  world  in  terms  of  perception,  understanding,  
and interpreting.  
Every organization, including the church, is built upon underlying 
paradigms or assumptions. This is not the same thing as the church’s 
beliefs or theological systems. Rather, the paradigm determines how 
an  organization  thinks  and  acts.  Paradigms  explain  behavior  then  
guide behavior. If we try to restructure an organization but leave the 

7
original paradigms in place, then little will change. For real change 
to  take  place,  we  need  a  paradigm  shift  or,  in  most  cases,  multiple  
paradigm shifts.  
A  paradigm  shift  occurs  when  there  is  a  fundamental  change  in  
an underlying assumption. It’s a change from one way of thinking 
to another, a rethinking. There is a transformation, a sort of meta-
morphosis that takes place. For the church to move from a mindset 
of addition (simply planting growing churches) to one of multipli-
cation  (planting  reproducing  churches),  the  church  must  rethink  
several  key  shifts  in  the  way  we  think  and  the  way  we  behave.  
While it isn’t complicated, it is certainly multifaceted. 
When I first wrote Rethink,  I  shared  9  paradigm  shifts  to  activate  
the  church.  Since  that  time  and  based  on  the  feedback  I  have  
received  from  church  leaders,  that  initial  list  has  grown.  In  this  
revised and expanded version, I now unpack 12 missiological prin-
ciples we must rethink to activate the people of God to engage in 
His  redemptive  mission.  Separately,  none  of  these  principles  are  
a cure-all for what ails the church in North America. However, as 
we begin to think and act differently, I believe there is a synergistic 
effect within these missionary arenas that will lead to multiplica-
tion of disciples and churches.
The strategies and models that fit earlier eras of church history are 
simply no longer effective. What we need now is a new set of tools. 
We need a fresh perspective—a new paradigm—and must rethink 
church multiplication, especially as it relates to our understanding 
of the church, mission, and church planting.
