RETHINK TEAMS
“In the New Testament there are functional distinctions 
between various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical 
division between clergy and laity.” —Howard Snyder
There is an adage that speaks to the importance of change in an 
organization. The saying goes, “We are perfectly designed to achieve 
what we are currently achieving.” If we apply this statement to the 
church, a question we might ask is: are we satisfied with what we 
are currently achieving? In other words, are we totally content with 
the impact the church is having? If we are totally honest, the answer 
would likely be a resounding no.
If we are perfectly designed to achieve what the church is currently 
achieving, then shouldn’t we ask if there is an issue in the way we 
are designed? Or at least question if there is an issue in the way we 
understand the nature of the church and its place in God’s mission? 
Are there “design” factors that we need to rethink to achieve the 
outcomes we desire?

49
Part of the solution is found in rethinking the nature of the church, 
mission, culture, multiplication, and vocation. However, I believe 
there is also an organizational issue to be addressed. The church 
must activate every member of the body. 
CLERGY-LAITY DIVIDE
Before we address how to look at the gifting and functions of the 
body of Christ, let’s consider a general view of leadership that has 
kept the church from fully realizing its calling. I am referring to what 
is considered the clergy-laity divide. 
The word laity comes from a Greek word laos, meaning “people of God.” 
Today we often use the related term “layperson” to distinguish from 
“professional.” A layperson is someone in a particular discipline who 
is seen as an “amateur” who dabbles in an area but doesn’t operate 
with a high level of skill or expertise. The professional, on the other 
hand, is the expert. While there may be a place for this division in 
the business world and sports, there is no biblical basis for such a 
distinction in the church.
As Eugene Peterson writes
Within the Christian community there are few words that are 
more disabling than “layperson” and “laity.” The words convey 
the impression—an impression that quickly solidifies into a 
lie—that there is a two-level hierarchy among the men and 
women who follow Jesus. There are those who are trained, 
sometimes referred to as “the called,” the professionals who 
are paid to preach, teach, and provide guidance in the Christian 
way, occupying the upper level. The lower level is made up of 
everyone else, those whom God assigned jobs as storekeepers, 
lawyers, journalists, parents, and computer programmers.

Ministry is not set aside for some professional class within the church. 
All the people of God are called and commissioned. In The Community 
of the King, Howard Snyder speaks to this issue:
The New Testament doctrine of ministry rests not on the clergy-
laity distinction but on the twin and complementary pillars of 
the priesthood of all believers and the gifts of the Spirit. Today, 
four centuries after the Reformation, the full implications of this 
Protestant affirmation have yet to be worked out. The clergy-laity 
dichotomy is a direct carry-over from pre-Reformation Roman 
Catholicism and a throwback to the Old Testament priesthood. 
It is one of the principal obstacles to the church effectively 
being God’s agent of the Kingdom today because it creates a 
false idea that only “holy men,” namely, ordained ministers, are 
really qualified and responsible for leadership and significant 
ministry. In the New Testament there are functional distinctions 
between various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical division 
between clergy and laity.
26
We must “de-professionalize” ministry and give it back to the people of 
God. However, this does not mean we don’t have leaders. Any signif-
icant multiplication movement that makes an impact has definitive 
leadership, but we cannot confuse leadership with a call to participate 
in Jesus’ redemptive mission.
When we look at the early church, we see that everyone is regarded as 
a significant agent of the King and has a place in the unfolding of the 
movement. In other words, in the church that Jesus built, everyone 
gets to play. In fact, everyone must play!
THE IMPORTANCE OF APEST
So if we are to activate all of God’s people for mission, how do we 
accomplish this task? Part of the solution to diminishing the clergy-laity 

51
divide and helping the laos engage in mission and ministry involves 
broadening our concept of ministry. We need to move beyond ministry 
being framed simply by the traditional pastor-teacher model of the 
church to a fivefold understanding of ministry giftings as described 
in Ephesians 4:1-16. 
This fivefold framework is often referred to as APEST: apostle, prophet, 
evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. Most of the time, Ephesians 4 is 
viewed as a leadership text. In other words, we understand the gifts 
mentioned as leaders given to the church for the purpose of equipping 
the people of God. However, Ephesians 4 is about the ministry of the 
church. It is a body of Christ text. Paul is stating that the gifts given to 
the church are given to the laos—the whole people of God.
At the heart of this letter is Paul’s understanding and description of 
the essential ministry of the church. Consider it this way:
• In Ephesians 4:1-6, Paul calls us to realize our fundamental 
unity in the one God.
• In Ephesians 4:7-11, he says that APEST has been given to the 
church by Christ.
• In Ephesians 4:12-16, he says why APEST is given to build up, 
reach unity, and become mature.
Paul outlines in simple terms the core ministries that make up the 
body of Christ. He clearly states that Christ has given certain gifts to 
each one and distributed them throughout the body as He sees fit. 
The ministry of the church is unmistakably stated as being at least 
fivefold in form through expression in the giftings of apostle, prophet, 
evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. And it is through the diversity of 
APEST that the church can operate in the fullness of Christ. 

52
The word equip in verse 12 is an interesting word choice. It was often 
used to describe the setting of a broken bone or alignment. Paul is 
saying that each of the ministries within APEST add to the ability 
of the entire body to function properly. Our ability to grow, mature, 
and become the church that Jesus intended is directly linked to the 
ministries within APEST. 
Sadly, most churches operate with only two out of the five: shepherding 
and teaching. In most cases, the ministries of the apostle, prophet, and 
evangelist have been minimized, if not completely relegated to the 
margins. When we do this, we essentially cut off three-fifths of our 
capacity to grow and mature as the body of Christ. This has damaged 
the church’s ability to be the fullness of Jesus in the world.
APEST SUMMARY
Here are summaries of each APEST ministry. 
APOSTLE: SENT AND EXTENDS
The word apostle literally means “sent one.” The Latin form is missio, 
which is where we get the English word mission. The apostle is most 
responsible to activate, develop, and protect the missionary sentness 
of the church. This sent quality gives the apostle’s life a catalytic 
influence, often playing the role of an entrepreneur at the forefront 
of new ventures. They are the cultural architects who are concerned 
with the overall extension of Christianity throughout society. Because 
of this, they are often drawn to issues related to design, systems, and 
overarching organizational structures. They have a missional focus 
to their ministry.
PROPHET: QUESTIONS AND REFORMS
Prophets are sensitive to God and what is important to Him. They 
often sense what truth needs to be emphasized for their time and 

53
place. Prophets are guardians of the covenant relationship. Whether 
it is in the church, society, or an organizational setting, prophets are 
quick to recognize the gap between “what is” and “what should be.” 
The weight of this tension leads prophets to question the status quo 
as well as initiate efforts for reform. Ultimately, they are not satisfied 
until they see a “closing of the gap” between God’s demands and our 
covenantal faithfulness. This desire to see the truth of God’s reality 
fleshed out in concrete and tangible ways gives an incarnational 
quality to their ministry.
EVANGELIST: RECRUITS AND GATHERS
Evangelists communicate the message of the gospel in joyous, infec-
tious ways. They enjoy meeting new people and wooing them into 
a friendship. They are avid communicators of ideas and often share 
their thoughts and feelings in convincing ways. They are recruiters to 
the cause and find fulfillment in helping people get caught up into the 
driving narrative of the church—the gospel of the kingdom. As bearers 
of good news, they have an attractional quality to their ministry.
SHEPHERD: PROTECTS AND PROVIDES
Shepherds protect the community from danger and provide for its 
needs on both an individual and communal level. They notice when 
people are alone or hurting and feel drawn to nurture the spiritual 
and communal health of the church. They are loyal to the organization 
and the people within it. They ensure the community is experienced 
as a safe and loving environment, giving their ministry a distinctly 
communal focus.
TEACHER: UNDERSTANDS AND EXPLAINS
Teachers find great satisfaction in helping people learn truth and 
wisdom. They grasp complex, systemic truths then help people 
understand them. They often formulate curriculum and pathways 

54
of learning. They ensure the truths of Scripture are passed from 
generation to generation. Their ministry could be summarized as 
instructional in nature.

APEST AND MULTIPLYING CHURCHES
When considering the importance of developing a team, it is essential 
to note that there isn’t a single solution for every context. However, 
developing a multiplying church that is effectively engaging its context 
will no doubt involve team dynamics that are informed by the fivefold 
typology of Ephesians 4. 
Practically speaking, how do you incorporate APEST into the devel-
opment of a team?  
1. Understand your gifts considering APEST because it will 
influence where you focus your ministry. Example: A teacher 
will focus on a Sunday gathering to teach. 
2. Understand the makeup of your team and recognize what 
gifts may be missing. If you are a gifted shepherd, you need 
someone apostolic or you will never start something new. But 
likewise, if you are apostolic, you must have a shepherd or you 
will likely push people too hard and run the risk of burnout.
3. Determine how each gift will have equal input into the mission 
and ministry of the church. Remember that a key aspect of 
Ephesians 4 is that the church will not reach maturity unless 
all five gifts are activated and exercised. 
4. Determine how to ensure the equipping of the saints. How will 
you encourage and empower those with the gift of teaching to 
equip other teachers? How will those who have an apostolic 
calling fan the flame of other sent ones? How will the evan-
gelist equip others who have an evangelistic calling?

55
5. Measure success. How will you measure success from an 
APEST perspective? How can APEST become a mark of the 
church? 
If these are functions of the community, here is one way to frame 
measuring language to determine how the church is doing in each 
area:
• A: missional impact 
• P: covenant faithfulness 
• E: gospel proclamation 
• S: reconciled community 
• T: deep wisdom
Remember, a church that can bring together, encourage, and capture 
the gifting of a fully functioning team will succeed in whatever it is 
seeking to achieve. APEST adds a necessary ingredient to the overall 
missional fitness and maturity of the church but must be informed 
and shaped by the others to anchor the church in the fullness of 
Christ’s nature and mission.
POSSIBLE OBJECTIONS
Amid conversations surrounding APEST, there are occasionally ques-
tions regarding the significance of Ephesians 4. Some will ask, “Are 
we putting too much emphasis on APEST, especially when it seems 
to be based on one passage of Scripture?” A second question often 
includes the other gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians and Romans 12. 
People ask why the gifts in Ephesians 4 are given prominence over 
gifts mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament.

56
The following responses should help address concerns you may have 
when considering APEST.
1. Biblical commentators have long-held Ephesians as a consti-
tutional document of the church. Like all constitutions, it is 
meant to guide subsequent thinking and action in the orga-
nization. The book represents the best way to think about the 
church—at least how Paul understood it.
2. Ephesians 4:1-16 presents a promise that no other passage of 
Scripture claims: maturity and fullness of Christ (vv. 11-16). 
If we desire unity (vv. 1-6) and strive for maturity (vv. 11-16), 
then it is difficult to discount the connection point between 
unity and maturity with the diversity of gifts given by Christ 
in verses 7-11. 
3. Ephesians  4  is  not  the  only  passage  in  which  APEST  is  
mentioned.
• Apostle is used over 80 times in the New Testament.
• Prophet is used nearly 800 times in Scripture, over 150 
times in the New Testament.
• Evangelist is used in Acts and 2 Timothy.
• Shepherd is used 23 times in the New Testament.
• Teacher is used 129 times in the New Testament.
• The word pastor, which we have no problem using as 
the catch-all for leadership, is used once, and it is in 
Ephesians 4. 
4. If you struggle to think about these gifts as personal callings 
or vocations (they are certainly not roles or offices), then at 
least consider them as communal functions of the church. 

57
Should the church be apostolic? Prophetic? Evangelistic? Is 
the church to be a shepherding and teaching community? The 
answer to each of these questions is a resounding yes! These 
five functions should define what the church does.
5. The key word in 1 Corinthians is “manifestations” or gifts of 
the Spirit. The gifts are tools given to execute the calling. The 
key word in Romans 12 is “praxis,” which is skill-based, while 
Ephesians 4 are callings given to the body by Jesus. The callings 
in Ephesians 4 are the people. Think of them as how we are 
wired instead of spiritual gifts given to a person. Compare the 
distinction between the passages to being a carpenter. If my 
calling is to be a carpenter, I am wired and gifted at carpentry 
work. However, as a carpenter I have several tools that I will 
use including a level, saw, hammer, and router.
Or consider the spiritual gift of hospitality. Someone wired as 
a shepherd may provide hospitality as they desire to welcome 
people into their home. But someone wired apostolically may 
be hospitable because they want to start something new and 
welcome others into that new adventure. The gift is the same, 
but the motivation is different.
6. Recognize the gifts are given to the church at Jesus’ ascension. 
Why, in His ascension, does Jesus bestow the fivefold approach 
on the church? 
• We   become   equipped,   perfected,   or   completed                  
(Ephesians 4:12).
• We can live out the unity described in Ephesians 4:1-6 
(Ephesians 4:13).
• We grow into maturity, so we attain the fullness of Christ 
(Ephesians 4:13).

58
• We are not given to theological fads or deception and 
will stand firm (Ephesians 4:14).
• We grow up into Christ, our head (Ephesians 4:15).
• We will be rightly ordered in our relationship to our 
head and to each other as His body (Ephesians 4:15-16).
7. Consider APEST to be broader than Ephesians 4. Some would 
argue that we can actually see APEST in the created order, 
not just the church. In other words, APEST is laced by God 
throughout His creation. Are there teachers in society? Shep-
herds? Evangelists? 
Further, and this is incredibly significant, APEST is incorporated 
fully  into  the  life  of  Jesus.  He  is  the  perfect  archetype  of  each  
gift.  He  is  the  ultimate  Apostle,  the  perfect  Prophet,  the  good  
news  Evangelist,  the  Good  Shepherd,  and  the  great  Teacher.
