Let’s first consider the missionary \nnature of God then discuss implications on the way we understand \nthe church.\nWhen we think about the attributes of God, we most often think of \ncharacteristics such as holiness, sovereignty, wisdom, justice, love, and \nso forth. Rarely do we think of God’s missionary nature. But Scripture \nteaches that God is a missionary God, a sending God.\n\n9\nThe missionary nature of God can be framed in two primary ways. \nThe first involves the grand narrative of Scripture. When we consider \nthe grand story or metanarrative of Scripture, we discover it is about \nGod’s redemptive purposes. All Scripture and doctrines of biblical faith \nconnect around God’s grand plan and purpose for creation. Mission \nis the central theme describing God’s activity throughout history to \nrestore creation. The mission of God unifies the Bible from creation \nto new creation.\n1\nA second way to recognize God’s missionary nature is to examine the \n“sending language” throughout the Bible. From God sending Abram \nin Genesis 12 to the sending of His angel in Revelation 22, hundreds \nof sending examples portray God as a missionary-sending God. The \nHebrew verb shelach, meaning “to send,” is found nearly 800 times in \nthe Old Testament. While it is often used in a variety of non-theological \nsayings and phrases, it is employed more than 200 times with God as \nthe subject of the verb. In other words, God commissions and sends.\nExodus 3:10-15 contains a fascinating dialogue surrounding God’s \nprompting of Moses to confront Pharaoh. God is sending Moses to \nconvince the king of Egypt to release the Israelites from bondage. In \nthe six verses, there are five references to sending. \n“So now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the \nIsraelites out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that \nI should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?” \nAnd God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to \nyou that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the \npeople out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.” \nMoses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to \nthem, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they \nask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” God \nsaid to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to \n\n10\nthe Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ” God also said to Moses, \n“Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the \nGod of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has \nsent me to you’ ” (emphasis added). \nThe prominence of sending language is not only seen in Genesis and \nExodus but throughout the historical, poetic, and prophetic books of \nthe Old Testament. God is a sending God. Especially when you consider \nthe prophets, it is easy to see that they were sent by God to participate \nin His redemptive purposes. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration \nof sending in the Old Testament is found in Isaiah 6. In this passage, \nwe catch a glimpse of God’s sending nature in its trinitarian fullness. \n“Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And \nwho will go for us?’ And I said, ‘Here am I. Send me!’” (Isaiah 6:8, \nemphasis added).\nLater in Isaiah 61:1-3, it is interesting to note that there are no fewer \nthan seven acts of redemption that proceed from or depend on the \nHebrew verb “sent.” To emphasize how central the sending theme \nis, the passage could be rendered this way:\nHe has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,\nHe has sent me to proclaim freedom for the captives,\nHe has sent me to release from darkness for the prisoners,\nHe has sent me to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and \nthe day of vengeance of our God,\nHe has sent me to comfort all who mourn,\nHe has sent me to provide for those who grieve in Zion,\nHe has sent me to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead \nof ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of \npraise instead of a spirit of despair. \n\n11\nJesus applies this passage to His own ministry in Luke 4:18-19 as He \nclaims to be the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1-3. These verses become, in \na sense, the personal mission statement for Jesus.\nThe Old Testament ends with God promising to send a special \nmessenger as the forerunner of the Messiah: “I will send my messenger” \n(Malachi 3:1, emphasis added). The New Testament begins with the \narrival of that messenger in the person of John the Baptist, described \nin the Gospels as “a man sent from God” (John 1:6).\nIn the New Testament, sending language is found not only in the \nGospels but throughout Acts and the Epistles. The most comprehensive \ncollection of sending language, however, is found in the Gospel of \nJohn, where the word send or sent is used nearly 60 times. Most uses \nrefer to God as the “one who sends” and Jesus as the “one who is sent.” \nWe see God the Father sending the Son, God the Father and the Son \nsending the Spirit, and God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit sending \nthe church. In the final sending passage in John, Jesus makes clear \nthat He is not only sent by the Father but now He is the sender, as \nHe sends the disciples: “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you” \n(John 20:21, emphasis added).\nWith this sentence, Jesus draws more than a vague parallel between His \nmission and ours. Deliberately and precisely, He makes His mission the \nmodel for ours. Our understanding of the church’s mission must flow \nfrom our understanding of Jesus’ mission as revealed in the Gospels.\n\n12"},"principle-10":{title:"Principle 10: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK STRATEGIES \nAND MODELS\n“No strategy will reach every kind of person except \na  strategy  that  mobilizes  every  kind  of  person.”                   \n—Brian Sanders \nChurch multiplication and church planting take many different \nforms; therefore, defining the models is a difficult task. However, \nas we discuss how to rethink church multiplication, here are four \napproaches in the church planting landscape.  \n• Contemporary attractional or launch\n• Missional communities or microchurches\n• Campus or multisite\n• Replant \n\n60\nCONTEMPORARY ATTRACTIONAL    \nOR LAUNCH\nIn a contemporary attractional or launch model, a church planter \nbegins with a launch team. In some cases, the church plant may \neven begin with a small staff. This model seeks to build a core group, \nusually 30–50 people, which will become their launch team. Often \nthere is a “sending church” that is large enough to send the people \nthat make up the initial team. \nOnce a launch team is formed, the church will conduct a series of \npreview services to give the target community a picture of what \nthe church will be like before it goes public. In some cases, a church \nplant may refer to this as a “soft launch,” where the core group holds \ncorporate gatherings that are less publicized to increase the size of the \nlaunch team and build momentum. At the time of the “hard” launch, \nthe church will send out a mass-mailer or other marketing to invite \nthe community to attend the new church.\nBecause much of church planting over the past four decades has been \nfocused in suburban areas populated by middle to upper class families, \nthe launch model has been effective. However, it has lost some of its \neffectiveness in areas saturated by other contemporary churches. And \nas North America is increasingly becoming a missionary context, the \npercentage of people open to this kind of church plant is declining.\nADVANTAGES \nLaunching large breaks growth barriers. Begin small, and chances \nare the church will remain small. But start large, and the church will \nbreak growth barriers quicker. One effective way to shatter growth \nbarriers is with momentum created by launching large. Momentum is \none of a planter’s best tools for growth. Launching large can produce \ntremendous momentum.\n\n61\nLaunching large provides credibility. When a first-time guest walks into \na new church and sees a large crowd, they immediately sense that \nsomething good is happening, and the credibility of the church increases.\nLaunching large facilitates financial sustainability. By launching with \na large group, the church may be able to quickly become financially \nsustainable. Learning to effectively raise funds and creating a well \nplanned budget for a new church are foundational for launching \nlarge and becoming self-sustaining within a couple of years.\nPOSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES\nLaunching large has a higher cost. On the flip side of becoming finan-\ncially sustainable faster, it costs more to launch a large church. Further, \nmany expenses will be up front, including rent for a meeting space, \nsound system and video equipment, computers, musical instruments, \nand supplies for children’s ministry. Marketing for the launch is \nanother significant financial commitment.\nLaunching large can be stressful. Beginning with a church of 100 or \nmore people will create challenges with assimilation, programming, \nand development. Because of the potential to start with a large \ngroup, the planting team will need systems in place prior to the first \npublic service. Rather than simply going through a worship service, \nplans will have to be made for children, parking, group space, and \nso forth before the church opens its doors. This can be stressful and \ntime-consuming.\nMISSIONAL COMMUNITIES             \nOR MICROCHURCHES\nProponents of a missional community or microchurch model propose \nthat when starting a new church, you should begin with missionary \nactivity and not with the corporate gathering. Church planting over \n\n62\nthe past several decades has really focused on a church service. When \nthe emphasis is on the large gathering, we can lose focus on what God \nis doing in the surrounding context. Further, because many people \ntoday are less interested in the programs and activities of the church, \nstarting a church by attempting to attract people to attend a corporate \ngathering may prove to be difficult. \nWHAT IS A MISSIONAL COMMUNITY?\nMissional communities are not smaller church services, Bible studies, \nsmall groups, or other programs of the church. Instead, missional \ncommunities are the church. Those who follow this model will gather \ntheir missional communities into a corporate setting once there are \nthree or more communities. They may meet once a month then choose \nto gather on a weekly basis.\nMany have been so conditioned by what they have experienced through \ntypical church activities that they naturally seek to make missional \ncommunities fit what they have known before. Other programs and \nactivities of the church are great for the purposes they serve, but they \ndo not generally deliver on the purposes of missional communities.\nA missional community is a committed group of Jesus followers, the \nsize of an extended family (12–25 people), and empowered by the \nSpirit to participate in God’s mission of redemption in a particular \nneighborhood and/or network. Hopefully, this definition offers a \nframework to differentiate a missional community from a traditional \nsmall group. It is important as you define what a missional commu-\nnity looks like in your context that you are not too prescriptive. In \nother words, allow each missional community to be unique to their \ncontext and mission. All missional communities will not, and should \nnot, look alike. \n\n63\nMICROCHURCHES\nWhile microchurches share several characteristics with missional \ncommunities, there are a couple differences. Like missional communities, \nmicrochurches see mission as the organizing principle of their existence. \nHowever, microchurches not only focus on specific neighborhoods \nand networks of relationships but engage in specific problems. These \nareas of missional engagement could include poverty issues, human \ntrafficking, education, crime, homelessness, mental health, and other \nareas of brokenness where gospel restoration is needed.\nThe language of microchurch provides a broader umbrella to encom-\npass a variety of church expressions. How and where microchurches \ngather and engage their missional contexts will be different. Some \nwill meet in their homes, as that approach often makes sense for \nreaching a neighborhood or a social network. Others will meet \nin coffee shops, caf\xe9s, community centers, apartment complexes, \nand the like. \nLike missional communities, microchurches will not, and should \nnot, look alike. Perhaps the greatest distinction between a missional \ncommunity and a microchurch is that microchurches are seen as \nthe church in its smallest, most nimble, and potent expression. Most \nmissional communities are closely “tethered” to the larger church. \nMissional communities are seen by many as an outreach expression \nof the church. \nMicrochurches, on the other hand, give special emphasis to empow-\nering people to use their gifts and resources to engage in God’s redemp-\ntive mission. They provide an opportunity for localized leaders to \ncreate and contextualize expressions of the church. They give both \nthe license to lead and creative control. This does not negate the \nbenefits of networking microchurches together for the sake of training, \n\n64\ncoaching, accountability, and movement. However, those resources \nexist to support the microchurches, not for the microchurches to \nsupport the network.\nADVANTAGES\n• They are highly relational. Both missional communities and \nmicrochurches network and build bridges throughout the \ncommunity, including neighborhoods, businesses, schools, \nnon-profits, local government, and so forth.\n• They disciple their way into church planting. By loving and \nserving people through a growing network of relationships, \na missional community or microchurch will create space for \npeople to belong before they believe. In this space discipleship \nhappens, which in turn leads to the multiplication of churches, \nnot the other way around.\n• They are a better fit for certain contexts. A missional commu-\nnity or microchurch approach is more conducive in urban \ncontexts, along with places where meeting space is limited \nor expensive. The relational aspect is also more fruitful in \npost-Christian environments.\nPOSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES\n• Slower growth. The nature of a relational, disciple-making \napproach inherently leads to slower growth. A church planter \nthat  employs  this  model  needs  to  have  a  long  “runway”  \nperspective. \n• Financial stability. Because of the grassroots nature of this \napproach, the church plant may not experience financial \nsustainability for several years. However, because bivocational \nor covocational leadership best fits this model, the church plant \nmay be in a position to focus on steady, long-term growth.\n\n65\nCAMPUS OR MULTISITE \nMany churches find the campus or multisite model, compared to \nbuilding larger facilities, more fiscally wise and sustainable.\nADVANTAGES\n• They are well resourced. Multisite churches are usually well \nresourced—fiscally, organizationally, structurally, and profes-\nsionally—because they are connected to a main campus. This \nconnection strengthens the foundation of the new campus. \nMultisite and satellite campuses can also be a great incubator \nfor developing emerging leaders.\n• They are an effective way for an existing church to extend their \nreach. Churches who implement a multisite model can extend \ntheir mission and vision to a different geographical area. In \nmany cases, the campus is an area that already has people \nwho attend the main campus. The church can start with a \nbuilt-in launch team that understands the church’s vision, \nmission, and strategy. Many multisite churches embrace the \nmotto, “One church in multiple locations.” \nPOSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES\n• They can be personality driven. One drawback is that multisite \ncampuses can be built around a single personality, especially \nif the lead teaching pastor is the same for all campuses. When \nthe church is built upon one personality, the church can suffer \nwhen that person is no longer there.\n• They can lack contextualization. Another drawback is that \nthis model can create “cookie cutter” churches that are not \nproperly contextualized. When an existing church’s vision \nand mission is “imported” in a different geographical context, \n\n66\nit may not be a good fit for that location. Just because a church \nmodel and strategy are successful in one setting doesn’t guar-\nantee it will be effective in another.\nREPLANT\nThe replant process involves the decision to close an existing church \nand relaunch as a new church, with new leadership, a new name, \nnew governance, and a new ministry approach. In this model, a \ndying church avoids permanent death by recognizing it will no longer \nflourish unless conditions drastically change to facilitate growth.\nADVANTAGES\n• Builds on the history or legacy of the previous church. This may \nhelp those who would prefer the status quo and recognizes \nthe church’s past impact in the community.\n• A new identity creates momentum. Establishing a new identity \nin the community can create momentum, enthusiasm, and \ninterest in the replant.\n• Offers a break with the past and a fresh start for the future. Setting \nan end date and a launch date avoids permanent death of \nthe church.  \nPOSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES\n• Requires a new leader and a decision-making structure.  To  \nreplant, a new leader and new structure and approach for \nmaking decisions must be in place. \n• Those in power may reject the new leadership structure. A new \nleadership structure is sometimes rejected by those in power. \n• Patience is essential. The average turnaround time for a replant \nis 5–7 years, so patience is key. \n\n67\nFINAL CONSIDERATIONS\nLearn and implement the strengths of different models. There are \nstrengths and challenges of every model. While you may operate \nfrom one model, it is helpful to incorporate the strengths from other \nmodels. Perhaps in your context you should consider a hybrid that \ntakes the best of multiple models and implements them to suit your \nneeds for multiplication.\nPick a model that fits who you are and where you are. Do not import \na model from another leader or context. When considering church \nmultiplication, leaders are often guilty of attending a conference or \nvisiting another church and concluding that they want to plant the \nchurch they have seen or heard about in their context. But resist the \ntemptation to import a model from outside your context. Pick a model \nthat fits your giftedness and your context.\nRemember the model is just a tool, not the target. We live in a highly \npragmatic culture and want to know what works. We want to utilize \nthe products or approaches that produce the best results. But the \nmodels are simply tools. Don’t put your faith in them to produce \nresults only God can produce. Instead, focus your faith on the calling \nthat God has put on your life for a particular place and people group.  \n\n68"},"principle-11":{title:"Principle 11: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK FLOW\n“If we fail at engaging well and living as Christ would live \namong our neighbors and friends, we fail as missionaries \nand the culture doesn’t see the visible beauty of the sent \nchurch.” —Hugh Halter \nTraditionally, we start with church then disciple people and send them \non mission if we want to see multiplication. But, in a post-Christian \ncontext, we must start with discipleship and mission then work \ntoward church. The most effective approach to multiplication is to \nbegin with missionary activity.\nThis is what is meant by the phrase missionary flow. It’s a simple way \nto rethink the flow or direction of starting a new church. We need \na new framework, a new way to think about planting that doesn’t \nbegin with Sunday.\n28\n\n69\nMissionary Flow\nEngaging\nContext\nCultivating\nCommunity\nStructuring\nCongregation\nLet’s consider each circle individually.\n \nENGAGING CONTEXT\nToo often church multiplication starts with Christians from another \nchurch or they gather disconnected believers from around a city. \nThis is well-intentioned and might be better than nothing at all, but \nin most cases, this is simply starting a church with a church. This is \nnot what we are talking about with missionary flow. Missionary flow \nmeans starting from scratch.\nThe first phase of any mission must involve contextualization, under-\nstanding the local setting so you can best engage people relationally. \nAlong with understanding the context, we need to remember that \nwe are a sent, missionary people. In other words, we have already \nbeen sent into our neighborhoods. We have already been sent to our \nworkplaces. We have already been sent to the social spaces we inhabit \neach day. We don’t have to wait, wondering where God might send \nus. Instead, we already live, work, and play in these places for the \npurpose of God’s mission.\nThis is where our church multiplication efforts need to start. We must \nidentify the places and people to whom God has sent us. Incarnate \ninto those places. Pray and listen for what God is doing. Discern how \n\n70\nHe wants us to participate as we begin to understand, relate to, and \nconnect with people. Start with discipleship and mission and work \ntoward church. \nCULTIVATING COMMUNITY\nThe word cultivating speaks to the idea of nurturing. When we culti-\nvate soil, we prepare it for planting. We have no power to make crops \ngrow, but we can nurture conditions that will increase the likelihood \nfor growth. Cultivating community is similar. We can’t make commu-\nnity happen, but we can create opportunities and environments in \nwhich community can flourish.\nWe use the word community to make a distinction from the more \ncustomary word church. Cultivating community involves creating \ntime and space for people to connect relationally with you but also \nwith each other. The key is that this space is not seen as a church \nbut instead as a place where relationships are developed. When \nrelationships begin to develop, you are building “social momentum.”\nExamine the updated missionary flow and notice two additional \nphrases and arrows. \n \n \nMissionary Flow\nEngaging\nContext\nSocial Momentum\nSpiritual Momentum\nCultivating\nCommunity\nStructuring\nCongregation\n\n71\nSOCIAL MOMENTUM\nSocial momentum creates spaces for Christians and non-Christians \nto connect, do life together, and build relational equity before they \nconsider attending a church. Unless we create a consistent, gathering \nenvironment—between engaging context and structuring congre-\ngation—that people can be invited to and be part of, we will never \nexperience social momentum in our missionary engagement.\nHere is another way to think about it. Most church planters are good \nat engaging context. They work at getting to know their neighbors. \nThey are intentional about making connections in coffee shops or at \nthe gym. They pay careful attention at their workplaces for oppor-\ntunities to make friends with coworkers. However, if there isn’t an \nongoing, somewhat informal “get-together” for the planter to invite \npeople to, they will simply have lots of surface connections that never \nmove beyond being acquaintances. After making connections with \nnew people, many church planters don’t have a clear vision of what \nto do next relationally. Too often, the step taken is to start a Sunday \nmorning worship service so there is a church activity to which new \npeople can be invited.\nNow, there is certainly nothing wrong with inviting people to church, \nbut in a missionary context, we need to consider an intermediate or \nin-between relational step. There must be regular, relational spaces to \nwhich we can easily and naturally invite people. Without a consistent \nspace to welcome the people we have met while engaging in our \ncontext, we will never develop social momentum. Instead, we will \nsimply have relational connections that never move beyond knowing \neach other by name.\nSo, what do those relational spaces look like? We need to find some-\nthing we are already doing, or at least like to do, and develop a \n\n72\nconsistent rhythm where we can easily invite someone to join. For \nexample, maybe you have a fire pit in your backyard that you light \nevery Saturday night. Maybe it is a game night once a week or once a \nmonth in your home. Schedule a neighborhood potluck once a month. \nSharing meals is always a great idea.  \nThe point is that when you have an ongoing relational event, it is \nnatural to invite those you are trying to connect with. You could say \nto a coworker or neighbor, “Hey, on the first Saturday night of every \nmonth, we have a group of friends over to roast hot dogs and make \ns’mores around the fire pit. You are always welcome to join us.”\nCreating time and space to develop social momentum will provide a \nnecessary opportunity for Christians and non-Christians to begin the \nprocess of cultivating community within a neighborhood or network.\nSPIRITUAL MOMENTUM\nNow, back to missionary flow. \n \nThe new arrow coming out of cultivating community is spiritual \nmomentum. Much like developing social momentum, we need to \nthink about creating time and space but, in this case, to provide \nopportunities for people to grow spiritually.\nMissionary Flow\nEngaging\nContext\nSocial Momentum\nSpiritual Momentum\nCultivating\nCommunity\nStructuring\nCongregation\n\n73\nIt may be as simple as gathering to pray for one another, read through \nthe Gospels, or discuss what Scripture says regarding current events. \nIf we are truly doing life with unbelievers and developing social \nmomentum, then there will be those who desire deeper, more mean-\ningful conversations. It should be natural and easy to say to someone \nthat you have a group of friends that meet once a week to pray for \neach other and talk about spiritual things.\nIf we are starting with and connecting exclusively with non-Christians, \nthe group that provides spiritual momentum may be something brand \nnew. In other words, it may be formed directly out of the time and \nspace created to develop social momentum. However, if we have a \ngroup of Christians who are a part of a church planting team, this \nspiritual momentum group may be a missional community to which \nwe invite that person.\nSTRUCTURING CONGREGATION\nThe final circle is structuring congregation. There will come a time \nto form or structure a congregation. There will be many issues to \nconsider, such as governance, meeting rhythms, administration, \nbudgets, staffing, and so forth.\nDon’t forget that we are talking about the importance of thinking like \na missionary. Church multiplication is the outworking of mission and \ncommunity. Structuring a congregation is the outworking of engaging \ncontext and cultivating community. Church multiplication is the point \nwhere mission and community intersect. At the heart of God’s plan \nto bless the nations are the people of God. The church is formed by \nmission and is formed for mission. \n\n74"},"principle-12":{title:"Principle 12: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK SCORECARDS\nWhat if our church saw as its goal the Kingdom of God in-\nstead of the number of bodies it gathered and organized \ninto straight rows? —Jeff Christopherson\nIn the 1950s, a 33-year-old left-handed pitcher made major league \nbaseball history. Harvey Haddix struck out 27 consecutive batters. \nAfter nine innings, the scoreboard read all zeroes. No runs, no hits, \nno errors, no walks. \nBut Harvey’s teammates forgot something amid their excitement \nover his historic performance. The scoreboard had another zero. The \ngame was not over. It was tied. Harvey would go on to pitch another \namazing three innings, 12 full innings of perfect pitching.\nSo, why have so few people heard of Harvey Haddix and arguably \nthe greatest game ever pitched? Because he lost the game. Harvey’s \nteam failed to score, and the Braves ultimately reached the plate in \nthe thirteenth inning because of an error.\n29\n\n75\nWhat does this 1950s baseball game have to do with the church in \nNorth America? I would argue that it is entirely possible for church \nleaders to have impressive statistics regarding filled seats and still lose \nthe game because they have little to no effect in their community. It’s \npossible to grow a “great” church but fail to make disciples. It doesn’t \nhave to be this way. Church leaders must stop being enamored with \njust one side of the scoreboard.\nTHE THREE COMMON METRICS\nWhen it comes to “keeping score,” churches in North America typically \nfocus on three metrics: buildings, budgets, and butts. While there is \nnothing inherently wrong with counting these things, we do need to \nask if keeping score of how big our buildings are, how much money \npeople give, and how many people show up is the best indicator of \nhow a church is doing. Do these metrics really measure how incar-\nnationally the body of Christ is living? \nThe fact is that these three metrics give us no real sense of the influ-\nence a church has on its community. Do the number of people who \nattend a Sunday morning gathering give you any indication of the \nimpact the church is having on individual neighborhoods or the city? \nThe answer is a resounding no! There is no correlation between the \nnumber of people who show up for an event and the difference those \npeople are making where they live. The same is true with how much \nmoney people give to the church and how large a church’s buildings \nare. The reason we “count” those three things is because they are easy \nto count. But we must rethink to not count what is easy but measure \nwhat is important.\nCOUNTING AND MEASURING\nWhile we often use the language of “counting” and “measuring” \ninterchangeably, there is a difference between the two. We must make \n\n76\nthe distinction because the church has largely been in the counting \nbusiness, which has negatively influenced the way we think about \nthe nature of the church and limited our multiplication and impact \nin the world. We need to move to measuring more and counting less.\nCounting gives attention to numbers. The question is “How many?” \nIt is quantitative. Conversations about “How many?” are frequently \nconversations about resources but can also be about activities. Conver-\nsations about resources, in a time of limited resources, become conver-\nsations about sufficiency, “Do we have enough?” or, “How can we get \nmore?” Examples could include finances or people. We ask questions \nlike, “Do we have enough money for that mission?” or “Do we have \nenough volunteers for that ministry?” A quantitative question about \nactivities might be, “How many Bible studies took place this week?”\nMeasuring gives attention to change. When measuring, the question is \n“How far?” It is qualitative. Conversations about “How far?” frequently \ninvolve change that can be measured over a particular time, as \nin, “How far have we come over the past year?” “Has the quality of \nsomething changed over time? Has something gotten better, or worse, \nsince the last time we measured?”\nThere is a need for both counting and measuring. In all complex \norganizations, multiple tools are needed. However, like all tools, the \nright tool must be chosen for the job at hand. So, what should we \ncount and what should we measure? \nI hesitate to be too prescriptive because contexts are different. But \nlet me suggest some possibilities that will hopefully crack open your \nimagination for metrics that fit your community. Think of these as \nconversation starters for the scorecard your church should be tracking.\n\n77\nCOUNTING\nOne of the things we should count are missionary behaviors. For \nexample:\n• How many neighbors have I gotten to know by name in the \npast month?\n• How many coworkers have I gotten to know on a deeper level?\n• How many people have I had in my home this past month?\n• How many meals have I shared with people outside my church \nfamily this week?\n• How many times this week have I intentionally been a blessing \nto someone?\nWhat other missionary behaviors can you track that would help you \nsee if your church was living with gospel intentionality?\nIn Missional Renaissance, Reggie McNeal suggests developing new \nscorecards around six resources of the church: prayer, people, time, \nfinances, facilities, and technology. Here are a few ideas from each \ncategory to rethink outside the walls of the church.\n30\nPrayer\n• Number of people being prayed for both inside and outside \nthe church\n• Number of people prayed with during the week by church \nmembers\n• Number of prayer meetings conducted off church property\n• Number of prayer answers reported back to the church\n• Number of community leaders adopted and prayed for each \nweek\n\n78\n• Number  of  prayer  walks  taken  in  the  community  or  \nneighborhoods\n• Number of prayer cards received from community prayer \nboxes\n• Time spent in prayer in staff meetings for community needs\n• Number of times each week school teachers are prayed for/\nover\nPeople\n• Number of people engaged in financial planning\n• Number of people growing in financial giving to kingdom \ncauses\n• Number of people engaged in daily spiritual formation\n• Number of people pursuing an intentional learning agenda\n• Number of people reporting increased friendships over time\n• Number of people sent into trailer parks, apartments, retire-\nment centers\n• Number of community ministries adopted by church groups \nor classes\n• Number of people serving other people in some venue\n• Number of people serving as mentors\n• Number of people practicing an intentional blessing strategy\nTime and Calendar\n• Amount of time spent debriefing people engaged in commu-\nnity service\n• Time spent in mentoring people in the community beyond \nthe church\n\n79\n• Number of hours people spent in direct ministry to community \nneeds\n• Amount of time spent in gatherings celebrating stories of \ncommunity involvement\n• Number of hours each week members opened their homes \nto others\n• Hours each week spent supporting or ministering to single \nparents\n• Amount of time staff spent developing relationships with \ncommunity leaders\nFinances\n• Number of people reporting personal debt retirement\n• Number  of  people  increasing  their  generosity  through            \ncharitable giving\n• Number of people who have developed a personal budget\n• Percent of church budget moving toward externally focused \nministry\n• Percent of church debt reduced to free up dollars for people \ninvestment\n• Amount of money invested in microeconomic development\nFacilities\n• Number of schools using church facilities for activities\n• Number  of  community  organizations  using  the  church  \nfacilities \n• Space devoted to conversation-friendly areas\n\n80\n• Use of church land for soccer or baseball fields, basketball \ncourt, or skateboard park\n• Number of hours the facilities are used during the week by \npeople for personal growth such as exercise classes, tutoring, \nand life skill seminars\nTechnology\n• Number of podcast interviews with community leaders\n• Space on church website dedicated to community events and \nengagement\n• Number of webinars to educate people about missional \nopportunities\n• Number of graphics or videos telling the stories of missional \nengagement by members\nNot only does counting the right things give us a better indication of \na church’s engagement in the community, and ultimately its impact, \nbut it also illustrates to the congregation what is important. When we \ncount the things suggested, people know what is valued and know \nthe target for which they need to be aiming.\nMEASURING\nWhile all the suggestions can certainly help a church begin to move in \nthe right direction, these questions are still activities. They are more \nabout “inputs” rather than “outcomes.” Unfortunately, most often in \nthe church world, we stop with inputs.\nWe must focus on measurables that are outcome-based. Outcome-\nbased measurables are primarily focused on change. If we can \ndescribe the change we desire to see or make, we can also have \nconversations about whether we are moving toward that change \n\n81\nover time. Measuring relates not so much to what is but what could \nbe. It is more about possibilities. The best questions associated with \nmeasuring ask both about change and about time. For example, we \nmight ask, “How have the test scores changed over the past six months \nin the elementary school where the church provides tutors?”\nIn the context of the church, measuring is about determining trans-\nformational change in both people and in the neighborhoods where \nwe live. Ask, “What changes would you like to see in the lives of the \npeople but also in the life of your community?” That is an outcome. \nBut then ask the follow-up question, “What will it take to get to that \nplace?” Then begin to ask measurement questions toward that change. \n“How will we know if we are making progress in the right direction?” \n“What will we measure to determine transformational change?” \nMeasuring is definitely more difficult than counting, but it is essential \nif we are serious about making a difference. When something is \nmeasured and shows transformational change, it will be repeated \nand create a ripple effect. Rethinking scorecards will not only help \ncreate a more missional culture but people will also have a better \nidea of what is valued. \n\n82\nCONCLUSION:      \nTHINK LONG HAUL,  \nNOT QUICK FIX\nAs I noted in the introduction, the answer to the crises of the church \nin North America will not be found by making minor adjustments. \nSimply doing more of the same will not get us where we need to be in \nchurch multiplication. Instead, we must be willing to rethink deeply \nheld assumptions about the nature of the church, mission, discipleship, \nand leadership. Without these needed paradigm shifts in the way \nwe think, we will not be capable of making the necessary changes \nto activate all the people of God and engage His mission more fully.\nThe late Austrian philosopher, Ivan Illich, was once asked about the \nmost revolutionary way to change society. He answered the question \nthis way:\nNeither revolution nor reformation can ultimately change \na society, rather you must tell a new powerful tale, one so \npersuasive that it sweeps away the old myths and becomes \n\n83\nthe preferred story, one so inclusive that it gathers all the bits \nof our past and our present into a coherent whole, one that \neven shines some light into our future so that we can take the \nnext step. ... If you want to change a society, then you have to \ntell an alternative story.\n31\nThe church needs to tell an alternative story. Yet, it will be one that \nwill often run contrary to the story many evangelicals have been \ntold. It is a story of being sent rather than being served. It is a story \nof incarnating into local contexts. It is a story of activating all the \npeople of God, not just a few. It is a story of embracing the posture \nof a servant, rather than being in a place of power and privilege. I \nwould argue that at least in part, the story is tied up in the realization \nand application of the principles laid out in this book.\nHowever, for many these shifts will not come easy. Be patient. \nRemember  the  deeply  held  assumptions  we  have  discussed  \nthroughout this book are indeed deeply held. Seventeen hundred \nyears of Christendom will not be extracted from your church quickly. \nRethinking rarely happens overnight. Most people will need to visit \nand revisit these ideas. They will need to process with other people \nover time. In other words, a pastor can’t preach a 4-week sermon \nseries and somehow think everyone in the congregation is going \nto magically “get it.”\nInstead teach and talk about each of these principles, not just from \nthe pulpit, but one-on-one and in small group settings. Perhaps walk \nthrough this book with a group of early adopters who intuitively know \nthere must be an alternative story. A story where God is calling the \nbody of Christ to join Him in the restoration of all things.\n\n84\nENDNOTES\n1.

Why should we consider God as a missionary \nGod by examining sending language in the Bible? If God is a missionary \nGod (and He is!), then we as His people are missionary people. The \nnature and essence of the church is rooted in the missionary nature \n\n13\nof God. Another way to articulate this truth is to say that the church \ndoesn’t just send missionaries; the church is the missionary. \nIndividually and collectively as the body of Christ, we are a sent, \nmissionary church. We should be sending people in the church out \namong people of the world rather than attempting to attract people \nof the world in among people of the church. The reason we start with \nthis crucial distinction is because most people in the church today \ndo not think of their congregation in a sending, missionary manner.\nREFORMATION HERITAGE VIEW \nPeople today understand the church in two prominent ways. The first \nview is what some call the “Reformation heritage” perspective.\n2\n The \nmain idea behind this understanding of the church is that Protestants \nhave inherited a particular view of church from the Reformers, which \nemphasizes the right preaching of the Word, the right administration \nof the ordinances, and the proper exercise of church discipline. \nHistorically these have been referred to as the “marks” of the church. \nWhile each of the three marks are important aspects of church life, this \nview has left us with an understanding of the church as a place where \ncertain things happen. In other words, a person goes to church to \nhear the Bible taught, to participate in the Lord’s Supper and baptism, \nand, in some cases, to experience church discipline. Once again, all \nvery good things, but is that the way we want to define the church? \nDo these marks speak to the real essence and nature of the church? \nCONTEMPORARY VARIATION VIEW\nThe second view is a slight variation on the Reformation heritage defi-\nnition. The contemporary variation view is perhaps the most prevalent \nway people in North America understand the church today, as a vendor \nof religious goods and services. From this perspective, members are \n\n14\nviewed more as customers for whom religious goods and services are \nproduced. Churchgoers expect the church to provide a wide range of \nreligious services, such as great worship music, preaching, children’s \nprograms, small groups, parenting seminars, and so forth. \nOne of the key issues with both views of defining the church is that \nthe church is seen as an institution that exists for the benefit of its \nmembers.\nThe church should not be viewed as a place where certain marks must \noccur or as a consumer interaction that provides services. The nature \nof the church—rooted in the very nature of God—is missionary. The \nchurch is a people called and sent by God to participate in His redemp-\ntive mission in the world. Rather than seeing ourselves primarily as \na sending body, we must see ourselves as a body that is sent. \nOf course, the church still gathers, but the difference is that we don’t \nsimply gather for our own sake, but for the sake of others, or better \nyet, for the sake of God’s mission. We come together as a collective \nbody to be equipped through prayer, worship, and study to then be \nsent out into the world. The church is meant to be a gathered and \nscattered people. \nMissionary Lesslie Newbigin stated it this way, “The church is not \nmeant to call men and women out of the world into a safe religious \nenclave but to call them out in order to send them back as agents of \nGod’s kingship.”\nWHY THIS MATTERS\nTo grasp the importance of understanding the church as missionary, \nconsider the idea of cultural distance. This is a simple missionary \ntool to help discern just how far a person or a people group is from a \n\n15\nm0m1m2m3m4\nmeaningful engagement with the gospel. This image provides a visual. \nNotice the number scale. Each numeral with the prefix m indicates \na significant cultural barrier to the meaningful communication of \nthe gospel. Barriers include such things as language, race, history, \nworldview, traditions, beliefs, political affiliation, and so forth. The \ngreater the number of cultural barriers, the increased complexity \nthere will be in communicating with another person.\nIn The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the Missional Church, Alan Hirsch \noffers a description of how the scale might look in a local context.\n• m0–m1: People in this group have some concept of Christianity. \nThey would speak the same language, have similar interests, \nare probably the same nationality, and are from a similar \nclass grouping. Most of your friends would probably fit into \nthis group.\n• m1–m2: This group includes the average non-Christian, \nsomeone who has little awareness of or interest in Christianity \nand is somewhat suspicious of the church. This category might \nalso include those previously offended by a bad experience \nof church or Christians.\n• m2–m3: People in this group have no idea about Christianity \nor might be part of an ethnic group with different religious \nimpulses or a fringe subculture. This group will include people \nantagonistic toward Christianity as they understand or have \nexperienced it.\n\n16\nm0m1m2m3m4\n• m3–m4: This group might be inhabited by ethnic and religious \ngroupings such as Muslims or Jews. The fact that they are in \nthe West might ameliorate some of the distance, but just about \neverything else gets in the way of a meaningful dialogue. They \nare resistant to the gospel.\n3\n \nThis discussion is important because churches in North America often \noperate almost exclusively in the sphere of m0–m1, as illustrated in \nthis image.\nMany churches in North America function in a sort of Christian \nbubble where there are little or no cultural barriers. This problem is \nsignificant because, as we have stated previously, it is we who are the \ncalled, sent, missionary people of God, which will sometimes mean we \nmust go to where people are. If we fail to go to the people, the only way \nthey will encounter the gospel meaningfully is by coming to us. This \nis the built-in assumption of the attractional church, and it requires \nthe nonbeliever do the cross-cultural work to find Jesus, and not us! \nAnd make no mistake, for many people, coming to a church service \ninvolves serious cross-cultural work. When we ask them to come to \nus, we are in essence asking them to be the missionaries.\nInstead, we must see that we are missionary people, sent to participate \nwith a missionary God, who desires to reconcile all of creation to \nHimself for His glory. We, the church, are called to bless and reach \nthe nations.\n\n17"},"principle-3":{title:"Principle 3: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK                 \nINCARNATIONAL \nMISSION\n“In the incarnation of Jesus, God revealed himself as the \nOne who is with and for his creation. Now, as the Risen \nLord sends his Spirit to empower the church, we are \ncalled to become God’s people present in the world, with \nand for the world.” —Darrell Guder\nThe last two missiological principles we examined illuminated the \nmissionary nature of God and the “sentness” of the church. God is \na missionary God who sends a missionary church. However, being \nsent is only part of the story. The language of “incarnational mission” \nrepresents the rooting of our lives and the gospel into the place we \nlive. If the essence of missional living is sending, then the heart of \nincarnational mission is staying.\n\n18\nTHE INCARNATION\nThe word incarnation comes from a Latin word that literally means \n“in the flesh.” It refers to the act whereby God took on human flesh and \nentered our world to bring about reconciliation between Himself and \nhumanity. The incarnation is God’s ultimate missional participation in \ncreation (John 3:16-17). When God entered our world in and through \nthe person of Jesus, He came to live among us. He esk\xe9nosen—literally, \n“set up a tent.” In simpler terms, “The Word became flesh and blood, \nand moved into the neighborhood” (John 1:14, MSG).\nINCARNATIONAL MISSION \nIf God’s central way of reaching His world was to incarnate Himself \nin Jesus, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be \nincarnational. It is important to acknowledge that the incarnation \nof Jesus was a special, unrepeatable event. Though we will never \nbe able to embody God the way Jesus does, we ought to be able to \nmake a distinction between the Incarnation with a capital “I” and \nincarnational ministry.\nObviously, there is nothing wrong with inviting believers to model \ntheir lives after the life of Jesus. The apostles encouraged Christians to \nimitate Christ as a way of identifying with Him. Both Peter and Paul \ninsisted that Jesus is the model for Christian living. “To this you were \ncalled, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that \nyou should follow in his steps” (1 Peter 2:21). Peter makes clear that \nJesus’ life is to be our example. “Follow my example, as I follow the \nexample of Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). And Paul states that we can \nfollow his way of life because he is so closely following the way of Jesus. \nMissiologist Michael Frost elaborates on the theme of following Christ’s \nexample from the book of Philippians:\n\n19\nPaul makes this point even more strongly in Philippians, in \nwhich he tells us that our “attitude should be the same as \nthat of Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5). We often assume that \nthis passage then commends to us Jesus’ humility, which is \nclearly present in the text. But Jesus’ humility is commended \nto us insofar as it is expressed in his commitments to identi-\nfication and relinquishment. First, to follow Jesus’ example \nmeans that we should share his profoundly humble identifi-\ncation with sinful humankind (Philippians 2:7b-8a). Second, \nthose of us who wish to emulate Jesus should be aware of \nhis equally humble willingness to empty himself and make \nhimself nothing for the sake of God’s redemptive purposes \n(Philippians 2:6-7a). ... To embrace an incarnational ministry, \nthen, involves a willingness to relinquish our own desires and \ninterests in the service of others.\n4\nThis examination of the Philippians speaks to two very important \nideas related to incarnational mission—the concepts of proximity \nand presence.\nIncarnational mission involves living in close proximity with others. \nWe cannot love and serve those God has sent us to from a distance. \nJesus took on flesh and blood and moved into the neighborhood, so \nwe must do the same. This may require moving geographically to \nbe closer to those to whom God has sent us. At the very least, it will \ndemand creating time and space to be directly and actively involved \nin the lives of people we are seeking to reach. \nThe concept of presence moves beyond mere proximity to identifica-\ntion and surrender. Jesus identified with and advocated for those who \nHe was called to serve. As the Philippians passage makes clear, He \nhumbled Himself. He literally emptied Himself for the sake of others. \nThis realization reveals an incarnational approach that calls us to \n\n20\nrelational identification with our neighbors, leading us to tangible \nacts of love and sacrifice.\nJesus’ words from John 20:21 are most often used to emphasize the \nsending of the disciples and subsequently the church, “As the Father \nhas sent me, I am sending you.” But we must not neglect the first half \nof the passage. Jesus says, “As the Father has sent me ...” (emphasis \nadded). The word “as” (or in some translations “just as”) translates \nto “like” or “in a similar manner.” In other words, we need to be sent \nlike Jesus was sent. To whom and in what manner was Jesus sent? \nHe was sent to the down and outers of society. He was with and for \ntax collectors, the oppressed, the poor, and the diseased. If Jesus is \nour example, we are called to do likewise.\nIn The Incarnation and the Church’s Witness, Darrell Guder provides \nan insightful summary on the incarnation of Jesus and what it means \nto be a Christian.\nWe arrive at the concept of incarnational witness as one way \nof expounding on the character of our missionary vocation. In \nthe incarnation of Jesus Christ, God revealed himself as the One \nwho is with and for his creation. Now, as the Risen Lord sends \nhis Spirit to empower the church, we are called to become \nGod’s people present in the world, with and for the world, \nlike St. John pointing always to Christ. The most incarnational \ndimension of our witness is defined by the cross itself, as we \nexperience with Jesus that bearing his cross transforms our \nsuffering into witness.\nIncarnational witness is, therefore, a way of describing Chris-\ntian vocation in terms of Jesus Christ as the messenger, the \nmessage, and the model for all who follow after him. To speak \nof the incarnation missionally is to link who Jesus was, what \n\n21\nJesus did, and how he did it, in one great event that defines \nall that it means to be Christian.\n5\nNUTS AND BOLTS\nWhat does all this talk of identification, proximity, and presence have \nto do with daily living? It may sound clich\xe9, but it really is all about \nrelationships. It’s all about getting close enough to people to listen, \nunderstand their hopes and dreams, and coming to love them the \nway Jesus does.\nThe Gospels tell us that Jesus is a friend of sinners. Hear that—a \nfriend. What constitutes a friend? When another person invites you \nto meet their friends, you are in. The Bible is full of stories of people \ninviting Jesus to meet and spend time with their friends. People were \ndrawn to the mysterious love and holiness of Jesus. Someone once \nsaid that people who were not like Jesus liked Jesus. As followers of \nJesus, shouldn’t that also be true of us? That doesn’t happen without \nliving with and among people. What will it take for you to incarnate \nthe life of Jesus? What will it take for you to really move into your \nneighborhood, perhaps for the very first time?\nSEEKING THE WELFARE OF        \nYOUR CITY\nA fascinating passage in the Old Testament provides a picture of \nwhat it looks like to live out incarnational mission. It gives practical \ninstructions for digging into the places where we live. This is espe-\ncially helpful when Christians sense they are living in a world that \nis hostile toward their beliefs or living in a place that doesn’t really \nfeel like home.\nIn Jeremiah, we read how the nation of Israel had forsaken God’s \nlaw and found themselves taken into captivity, exiled far from their \n\n22\nJerusalem homeland. God sent the Babylonian empire to discipline \nHis people. As they were relocated to a foreign, idolatrous land, they \nheard whispers that their time in the hostile country would be short. \nFalse prophets began telling the nation of Israel that God would soon \ndeliver them and settling into this new, strange land was foolish. \nGod’s word through the prophet Jeremiah was quite the opposite.\nThus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles \nwhom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build \nhouses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce. \nTake wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your \nsons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear \nsons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But \nseek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, \nand pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will \nfind your welfare (Jeremiah 29:4-7, ESV).\n The words of Jeremiah were shocking. The premise of his message \nwas that the exiles would be in Babylon for several generations and \nthat the Israelites would simply need to come to terms with this fact. \nGod was telling them to settle down and get used to being in this \nhostile, ungodly place.\nJeremiah counseled his community not to be nostalgic for the past, \nfor the past could not be recovered. He did not advise them to plan \nfor insurrection, for there was no promise of their restoration in Jeru-\nsalem, at least not any time soon. Nor was the community’s survival \ntied to the remnant that remained in Jerusalem (Jeremiah 24:5-10). \nFor Jeremiah, exile did not mean that God had abandoned Israel. \nRather, exile was the place where God was at work. God’s purposes \nfor Israel were served by the Babylonian invasion.\n\n23\nJeremiah’s instructions were more counterintuitive than they might \nat first seem. He tells the Jews to “seek the welfare” of their captors \nand pray for the very people who destroyed their homeland, because \nthe welfare of the exiles and the captors were bound together. If God’s \npurposes for Israel were being fulfilled through their captivity, then \nas the exiles pursued the shalom of Babylon, God would provide \nshalom for those in exile.\n6\nIt seemed reasonable for the Jews to be hostile to their captors. It \nalso would have been natural for them to withdraw from the world \naround them. By the same token, it would have been easy for them \nto simply assimilate into the Babylonian culture. Any of these options \nwould have made sense in human terms. But God called the Israelites \nto something radically different, not to be defensive against, isolated \nfrom, or absorbed into the dominant culture but instead to be incar-\nnated within it.\n7\n He was calling them to dig into the place He had sent \nthem, to stay where they would be doing life for a long time.\nWhat God instructed the exiles to do is rather ordinary. Consider the \nlist from Jeremiah 29:\n• Build houses and live in them.\n• Plant gardens and eat their produce.\n• Have children.\n• Marry off your children so they have children.\n• Seek the welfare of the city.\n• Pray for the welfare of the city.\nNothing from this list is dramatic or miraculous. These are normal, \neveryday activities. It could represent any person, regardless of \nincome, social status, education, vocation, or geographical location. \n\n24\nThe way the kingdom of God takes root in the lives of people and \nultimately changes a city is by exiles living normal, everyday lives as \ncitizens of the King in every neighborhood and city. We build houses. \nWe plant gardens. We have children. We seek the welfare of our city. \nOften, the ways of Jesus are indeed local and ordinary.\nAre you willing to commit to the welfare of your city? Will you allow \nyour imagination to see a movement that begins with the local and \nordinary but over time becomes global and extraordinary? If your \nanswer is yes, then together let’s seek the welfare of our neighbor-\nhoods and let us strive for it to spill over into every nook and cranny \nof our city. \n\n25"},"principle-4":{title:"Principle 4: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK MISSIO DEI\n“The main business of many mission committees is to \ndetermine how to spend the mission budget rather than \nview the entire congregational budget as an exercise in \nmission.”  —Darrell Guder  \nThe fourth missiological principle is the concept of missio Dei. An \nEnglish rendering of this Latin phrase speaks to the “mission of God.” \nIt is God who has a mission to set things right in a broken, sinful world, \nto redeem and restore it to what He has always intended.\nMission is not the invention, responsibility, or program of the church. \nInstead, mission flows directly from the character and purposes of a \nmissionary God. In the words of David Bosch, “It is not the church which \n‘undertakes’ mission; it is the missio Dei which constitutes the church.”\n8\nIt is not only crucial to understand that God has a mission but equally \nimportant to understand that His mission is larger than the church. \nWe in the church often wrongly assume that the primary activity \nof God is in the church, rather than recognizing that God’s primary \n\n26\nactivity is in the world and that the church is God’s instrument sent \ninto the world to participate in His redemptive mission. \nBefore discussing how to live out a missio Dei theology in a practical \nmanner, let’s consider how the first four missiological principles \ncohere together. Remember, the first two principles reminded us that \nwe are a sent missionary people. The third principle instructs that \nwe are to incarnate or embed our lives and the gospel into the local \ncontext we have been sent. Missio Dei, then, simply states that God \nis already at work in the lives around us and our job is to figure out \nwhat God is doing and how He wants us to participate. \nGOD’S MISSION AS THE ORGANIZING \nPRINCIPLE\nA missio Dei perspective will shape our thinking in the manner we \nunderstand the form and function of the church. Typically, congre-\ngations view “missions” as simply one program or activity among \nmany other equally important functions of the church. Therefore, \nthe missions program is seen alongside that of worship, small groups, \nmen’s and women’s ministries, youth and children’s ministries, and \nso forth. When missions is viewed in this way, the business of many \nmission committees “is to determine how to spend the mission budget \nrather than view the entire congregational budget as an exercise in \nmission.”\n9\n However, when the church begins to define itself as an \nagent of God’s mission, it will begin to organize every activity of the \nchurch around the missio Dei.\nMission as the organizing principle means that mission goes \nway beyond being some sort of optional activity or program \nfor our churches. It actually is the organizing axis of the church. \nThe life of the church revolves around it. This is not to say \nthat we don’t do corporate worship, develop community, and \n\n27\nmake disciples, but that these are catalyzed by and organized \naround the mission function. Only in this way can we be truly \nmissional. Merely adding serving events or special outreach \ndays to our church schedules will not develop missional people \nnor make a missional church.\n10\nTo ensure clarity on this issue of God’s mission as the organizing \nprinciple for all activities of the church, let me state again that this \ndoes not minimize the need for and importance of the other functions \nof the church. It is simply stating that no other function of the church \ncan rightly be the organizing principle or the reason we come together \nin the first place. Worship should not be the organizing principle. \nCommunity should not be the organizing principle. Even evangelism \nshould not be the organizing principle.\nInstead, worship, community, discipleship, evangelism, and every \nother important activity of the church are properly understood and \ninitiated only when viewed through the lens of mission. Pause for a \nmoment and examine the image below.\n \nThe first image represents some activities of a local church. Most \nchurches have ministries for arts or worship, children, small groups, \nyouth, and so forth. However, one of the problems with a list like this, \nis that “missions” becomes just one activity of the church, alongside \nseveral other equally important aspects. These images illustrate the \nMISSIONS\nARTS\nCHILDREN\nSMALL GROUPS\nYOUTH\nETC.\nVS.\nMISSIONS\nARTS\nCHILDREN\nSMALL GROUPS\nYOUTH\nETC.\nMISSION\n\n28\nmove from “missions” as one among many functions of the church \nto “mission” being the organizing principle for all other activities or \nministries of the church.\n11\nIf we believe the church is really all about God’s mission, then God’s \nmission should inform everything else we do as a church. As the \nsecond image shows, we should remove the “s” of missions and put \nmission at the top to illustrate that the missio Dei should shape, or at \nleast influence, every other program and activity of the church. \nGOD’S MISSION AS THE           \nSTARTING POINT\nDetermining where and how we engage in God’s mission is the \nsecond way a missio Dei theology influences our activity. If the \nmission is God’s, and it is, then how do we step into it? How do we \ntruly participate in what God is doing? Geoffrey Harris provides \nthese helpful words: \nThe average church member may be reassured to know \nthat mission is instigated by the simple act of praying, and \nof listening to God, and following God’s guidance. In such \nfundamental activities all Christians can participate. In addi-\ntion, it is reassuring to know that God’s Spirit is at work in the \nworld prior to our engagement in any relationship or any \nwork of mission. The presence of God in the world means that \nanyone embarking upon God’s mission already has an ally \nand accomplice in the work. It becomes “mission alongside” \nrather than mission alone.\n12\n \n\n29\nFOUR STEPS TOWARD                 \nMISSIONAL ENGAGEMENT\nPractically speaking, what does it look like to do mission alongside \nwhat God is already doing? If it is God’s mission and not ours, how \ndo we know where, when, and how to participate? The answer, at \nleast in part, is that we must look for God’s activity in a local setting \nas the place to begin our missional engagement. Let me introduce \none way to determine what God’s local mission is and how a church \nbody can begin to participate in it.\n1. DISCOVER\nIf it is truly God’s mission and not ours, then we must first discover \nhow God is at work. The first step in discovering what God is doing is \nthrough listening. Individually and collectively, we must cultivate our \nability to listen well on three fronts: to the Spirit, to the local community, \nand to each other. It is impossible to ascertain the movement of God \nwithout carving out significant time to listen to His voice through \nprayer and Scripture, as well as the voices of those we desire to serve. \nIf the first step is about discovering, then the first question must be, \n“What is God doing in this place?”\nMission cannot be decided beforehand. It must be decided in relation \nto God’s activity in a local context. Instead of front-loading mission \nstrategies with what we think a community needs, we begin by \nlistening and learning what God is already doing. Only after discov-\nering what God is doing in a particular setting do we then ask how \nHe wants us to participate.\n2. DISCERN\nIn addition to listening, participating in God’s mission will involve \ndiscernment. Not only will we need to discover what God is already \n\n30\ndoing, but we will need to ask the follow-up question, “In light of our \ngifts and resources, how does God want us to participate in what He is \ndoing?” The fact is that we can’t do it all, which is true for both individual \nfollowers of Jesus as well as local congregations. But it is also true that \nGod has gifted us all to do something! The point of discernment is to \ndetermine where and how to participate in God’s mission.\n3. DO\nThis may seem obvious, but the processes of discovery and discern-\nment are useless if we do not obey what God is calling us to do. We \nmust acknowledge that following Jesus will often be costly. Therefore, \nwe need to ask, “Will we be obedient to costly discernment?” Or will \nwe put conditions on our obedience? Someone once said that you \nshouldn’t ask God to guide your steps if you are not willing to move \nyour feet.\n4. DEBRIEF\nThroughout the process of engaging God’s mission, we must create \nopportunities to reflect on our missional involvement. Sometimes this \nmay simply mean we need individual “down time” to reflect upon \nour activities. We may need to ask God to affirm our involvement or \nto ask for clarity. But it will also mean carving out time to reflect with \nothers among our faith community. We need to hear what others are \nseeing and sensing concerning God’s activities and to hear the stories \nof how others are engaging God’s mission. It is important for us to \noffer feedback on what we are sensing. \nThese four steps toward missional engagement help to put emphasis \non the context God has sent us to and on how God has already been \nworking in that place long before we ever arrived.\n\n31"},"principle-5":{title:"Principle 5: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK \nPOST-CHRISTENDOM\n“In Christendom the emphasis was on maintaining a \nsupposedly Christian status quo, but in post-Christendom \nit  is  on  mission  within  a  contested  environment.”                \n—Stuart Murray\nRemember the famous line from The Wizard of Oz, when Dorothy \nfirst arrives in Oz and realizes she is now in a world that is strangely \ndifferent? “Toto,” she says to her little dog, “I’ve a feeling we’re not in \nKansas anymore.” Dorothy’s surroundings were suddenly unfamiliar. \nThe people and places she was used to seeing no longer existed. She \nhad no idea where she was, but one thing was certain—everything \naround her had drastically changed.\n13\nA place that is strangely different describes the world around the \nchurch today. Culture has seemingly changed so quickly and radically \nthat many churches feel like exiles in a foreign land. Like Dorothy, \n\n32\nmany churches no longer recognize their surroundings. They don’t \ncompletely understand the changes that have taken place. They only \nknow that things are not like they used to be.\nCHRISTENDOM TO \nPOST-CHRISTENDOM\nNumerous factors have influenced the change we see in Western \nculture. Issues such as globalization, urbanization, post-modernism, \nand the rise of the information age have significantly influenced the \nchurch. However, nothing has shaken the foundations of the church \nover the centuries as much as the rise and fall of Christendom.\nIn 313 A.D., the Roman Emperor Constantine adopted the Christian \nfaith as his own and decided to replace paganism with Christianity \nas the official imperial religion. He brought the church in from the \nmargins of society, where it had been operating for the previous three \ncenturies and united it with the empire. By giving great resources and \nfavors to the church, Constantine set in motion a process that would \neventually bring all of Europe into a church-state relationship known \nas Christendom. It is difficult to overstate the impact Constantine’s \ndecision had on the Christian faith. A few of the changes that took \nplace included:\n• The assumption that all citizens were Christian by birth\n• Infant baptism as the symbol of necessary incorporation into \nthe Christian society\n• Sunday as the required day of church attendance, with penal-\nties for noncompliance\n• The definition of “orthodoxy” as the common belief shared \nby all, determined by powerful church leaders supported by \nthe state\n\n33\n• The construction of massive and ornate church buildings\n• A strong distinction between clergy and laity and the relega-\ntion of the laity to a largely passive role\n• The increased wealth of the church and the obligation of \nrequired tithes to fund the system\n• The  division  of  the  globe  into  either  “Christendom”  or  \n“heathendom” and the waging of war in the name of Christ \nand the church\n• The use of political and military force to impose the Christian \nfaith\n14\nThe net effect of Christendom was that Christianity moved from being \na dynamic, revolutionary, social, and spiritual movement to being a \nstatic religious institution with corresponding structures, priesthood, \nand rituals. The Christian faith moved from an integrated way of life \nthat was lived out seven days a week to an obligation that was fulfilled \nby attending a service at a set time.\nBy the middle of the 20th century, however, it was becoming clear \nin Europe that Christendom was in serious decline. People began \nto use the term “post-Christendom” to describe the church’s loss of \nsocial privilege. Others used it to refer to Western civilizations that \nno longer considered themselves to be Christian.\nIn the era of post-Christendom, the church returned to the margins \nof society, losing prominence and control. While once the majority, \nthe church became the minority. The shift from once being on the \nmargins of society, elevated to a place of control, then back again to \nthe margins is illustrated in this image.\n15\n \n\n34\nBefore Constantine, the dominant influence in society was the Roman \nEmpire and the church was a marginalized sect, located on the \noutskirts. However, while the church operated on the margins, we \nknow from Paul’s Epistles and early church history that the church \nwas making serious inroads into the Roman Empire. The second circle \nrepresents Christendom when the church became the dominant seat \nof culture, albeit corrupted with political and military power. Today, \nthe picture is of a church that has been relegated back to the margins. \nHowever, it is important to note that while those outside the church \nunderstood that Christendom was fading, many inside the church \nstruggled to realize the church was losing its footing. Consequently, the \nchurch was at a loss as to how to reach into the changing pluralistic, \npostmodern culture that had little interest in it.\nWHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?\nThe difficulty the church is experiencing today in trying to relate to \nculture is in large part due to our Christendom heritage. Many in the \nchurch still believe that Christianity is in a place of influence and \nsignificance and operate under the false assumption that Christendom \nis alive and well. While there may be some parts of the country that \nstill cling to Christian values, most of the population is rapidly moving \nA.D. 30\nPre-Christendom\nMid-20th Century\nPost-Christendom\nA.D. 313\nChristendom\nPrevailing Influencer of Culture\nROME\nMultiple\nIdeologies\n\n35\naway from the things associated with the church. In the eyes of many \noutside the church, the church has become completely irrelevant. \nThe decline of Christian influence in North America can be seen in \nmultiple ways. The most prominent is the continual drop in church \nattendance. But it doesn’t end there. In fact, every indicator that can \nbe used to measure church health is headed in the wrong direction. \nConversions. Baptisms. Membership. Retention. Participation. Giving. \nReligious literacy. Effects on the culture. Look at it from any direction. \nEverything is in decline.\n16\nThis is an enormous problem. While the church is less effective at \nreaching a changing world, many in the church continue to believe \nthat it maintains a central role in culture. Instead of leaning toward \nthe missionary vision of the church, we default to church as a place \nwhere certain things happen and wrongly assume that those outside \nthe church will be interested in what we do. But every statistic proves \nthat simply isn’t the case.\nLike Dorothy arriving in Oz, we must not forget that the religious \nlandscape around us has drastically changed. We are in a new land. \nAt times we may feel like exiles. But unlike many exiles, let us not \nyearn for what once was. Instead, let us seek to bring life and vitality \nto the land where God has placed us. Let us pray and toil for God’s \nkingdom to come to the cities and neighborhoods in which we live.\nThis may be a hard pill to swallow, but the reality is that North America \nis not a Christian place. Like Dorothy, we’re not in Kansas anymore! \nThe sooner we can come to grips with that reality, the sooner we can \nreturn to the revolutionary, missional movement exemplified for us \nin the early church.  \n\n36"},"principle-6":{title:"Principle 6: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK PLACE\n“To be a stranger in a strange land, to be lost ... is per-\nhaps  the  condition  most  typical  of  contemporary  life.”               \n—Iain Chambers\nThe film Avalon is a story of an extended family who arrives in America \nin the early 1900s. Avalon is the name of the neighborhood where \nthe family members settled. The first half of the film highlights the \nintegration of the extended family. Life in Avalon is lived with others \nand rooted not only in relationships but also in place.\nHowever, halfway through the film, three themes fragment the family: \nsuburbs, automobiles, and televisions. The rise of suburbs creates \nphysical distance between extended family members. The afford-\nability of automobiles enables the families to live in the suburbs, but \nthe fathers then spend less time at home as they commute to their \njobs. And the popularity of television leads to dinners in front of a \nscreen instead of conversations around a table. The film ends with \nthe resulting alienation and isolation of the extended family.\n17\n\n37\nThe Great Good Place by Ray Oldenburg highlights similarities I noticed \nin Avalon. Oldenburg contends that most communities in the United \nStates are void of relational vitality, primarily because of the loss of \nwhat he calls informal public places. He understands the absence \nof informal public life as the result of suburban sprawl and the rise \nof the automobile culture, both of which foster geographical and \nrelational separation between home and workplace. The problem \nis magnified by home entertainment that often inhibits face-to-face \ncommunication. Today, this issue has moved far beyond the intro-\nduction of television as portrayed in Avalon. Smartphones, computers, \ntablets, gaming devices, and streaming services provide limitless \nviewing options.\nThe warning that Oldenburg sounded over 30 years ago remains \nrelevant today:  \nThe problem of place in America manifests itself in a sorely defi-\ncient informal public life. The structure of shared experience \nbeyond that offered by family, job, and passive consumerism is \nsmall and dwindling. The essential group experience is being \nreplaced by the exaggerated self-consciousness of individuals. \nAmerican life-styles, for all the material acquisition and the \nseeking after comforts and pleasures, are plagued by boredom, \nloneliness, alienation, and a high price tag. America can point \nto many areas where she has made progress, but in the area \nof informal public life she has lost ground and continues to \nlose it.\n18\nLOOK AT ALL THE LONELY PEOPLE\nThe way of life in developed countries is greatly reducing the quan-\ntity and quality of our relationships. Most people no longer live in \nextended families or even near each other. When you add the high \n\n38\ndegree of mobility, a strong sense of individualism, and decreased \nopportunities for informal public life, isolation and loneliness become \nincreasingly common.\nWhile studies show that we are now actually “connected” to a larger \nand more diverse circle of people, nearly a quarter of Americans say \nthey have nobody to talk to. In 1985, that figure was 8 percent.\n19\n And \nthis is not simply a picture of solitary retirees. Middle-aged people \nare the loneliest group in the United States. According to one study, \n40 percent of adults ages 45–49 said they were lonely, up from 20 \npercent in the 1980s.\n20\nThe issue of isolation is compounded by a sense of detachment from \nplace. In a highly mobile society, people rarely feel rooted geographi-\ncally. We live as nomads, both figuratively and literally. But God created \nus as social, relational beings. We are created to be in a relationship \nwith the Creator but also to be in relationships with other people. \nWe have been formed with an innate need to know and be known.\nWORD BECAME FLESH AND BLOOD\nWhat then is the appropriate response to a culture of increasing \ndisplacement? Can something turn the tide of isolation? What practical \nactions can be taken to mend the broken pieces? To restore people \nand places to flourish?\nThe solution is no doubt multifaceted. It will involve a variety of \ntactics: engaging with our neighbors, restoring genuine community, \nsharing meals with others, welcoming strangers, and opening our \nlives to those who are disconnected. But in all of the practical actions, \nthe how must be rooted in the why of incarnational presence. The \njourney of restoring the relational fabric of our communities must \nbegin with our tangible presence in the place where God has called us. \n\n39"},"principle-7":{title:"Principle 7: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK VOCATION\n“Believers participate in Christ’s priesthood not within the \nwalls of the Church but in the daily business of the world.” \n—Lesslie Newbigin\nConsider for a moment what you did yesterday. How much of your \nday was spiritual and how much was secular?\nDoes selling insurance, running a coffee shop, driving for Uber, teaching \nat a public school, or waiting tables at the local restaurant matter to God? \nMost people would probably answer, “No, not much.” Yet, Christians \nmay spend more than half of their lives in work-related activities.\nRethinking vocation must start with a consideration of the sacred and \nsecular divide. Greco-Roman thought was that the world is divided \ninto two competing domains: the sacred or spiritual and the secular \nor material. Such a worldview tends to assume that the spiritual is the \nhigher realm and that the material world lacks deep meaning. This \napproach leads to multiple divisions in thinking, including dividing the \nclergy (spiritual) and the laity (secular), the church (spiritual) and the \n\n40\nworld (secular), and between so-called spiritual practices (Bible study, \nprayer, worship) and so-called secular practices (work, art, eating).\nThis approach happens often in our understanding of vocation. The \nword vocation comes from the Latin vocatio, meaning a call or summons. \nIt is normally used to refer to a calling or occupation that a person is \ndrawn to or is particularly suited for. In the 4\nth\n Century, Augustine \ncompartmentalized the way people lived. He divided life into the \ncontemplative life and the active life. The contemplative life was given \nto sacred things and was seen as a higher calling, while the active life \nwas given to secular things and regarded as a lower calling. This kind \nof thinking created a distorted view of work that continues today.\nFor example, the language of “full-time Christian work” or “full-time \nministry” is commonly used to describe those whose vocational calling \nis to be a pastor, missionary, or parachurch worker. However, a proper \nand biblical understanding is that all Christians are called to full-time \nministry, doing good work for the glory of God regardless of their \nvocation. If God reigns over all things, then all things are sacred. Too \noften, people leave their homes on Monday morning and somehow \nthink they leave God behind. Instead, the church needs to help people \nrecognize that regardless of what God has called them to do, they are \ncontributing to and participating in God’s redemptive mission.\nThis missiological principle is twofold. First, we need to understand the \nharm that this view of vocation has on our understanding of calling \nin general but also on our calling to both be in the marketplace and \nto be a faith community. \nSecond, we need to recognize how rethinking vocation can open other \nmissiological opportunities for church multiplication with those who \nare already in the marketplace. Then, we will begin to see the benefits \nof bivocational and covocational ministry. \n\n41\nBIVOCATIONAL AND COVOCATIONAL \nENGAGEMENT \nOften the language of bivocational invokes the thought of two distinct \nvocations. To help us reconnect the two, we might use the language \nof “covocation.” The prefix “co” is the reduced form of the Latin com \nwhich means “together” or “in common.” English words like cofounder, \ncopilot, or companion are examples of words that denote partnership \nand equality. \nCovocation embodies the reality that if a person is called to be a \ndentist, teacher, web-designer, or plumber and also called to start \na church, the different callings are not isolated from one another. \nInstead, they are interlinked and equal. The language of covocation \npushes against the temptation to compartmentalize different aspects \nof our lives. When we begin to understand that each of our callings \nare legitimate and necessary aspects of God’s mission, they can be \nleveraged together for His purposes. \nPerhaps the most significant benefit of being bivocational or covoca-\ntional is that it provides the planter greater opportunities to connect \nrelationally with people in the community. Some people have referred \nto this as “marketplace mission” because relationships develop as a \nresult of the planter’s vocational connections. Their marketplace job \nis not a hindrance to what God is doing but an advantage to engaging \nGod’s mission. \nBeing bivocational or covocational gives planters access to a mission \nfield that is not readily available to a pastor who is employed full-time \nby a local church. Many of these pastors find themselves working \ninside a church bubble, spending most of their time talking with \nchurch people about church things. Even when a pastor makes \nthe effort to engage people in their community, they often find it \n\n42\nchallenging to fully relate. It is not until a person incarnates into the \nlocal context that they begin to understand the values and interests \nof the people in their community.\nBivocational or covocational ministry also helps to diminish the sacred \nand secular divide with respect to vocation. The congregation can see \nthe planter model the truth that all vocations are sacred. Whatever \nwork God has called a person to do, it is a sacred calling. As a result, the \nbenefits of being in the marketplace are multiplied exponentially as \nevery member recognizes how their vocation fits into God’s mission. \nAnother missional benefit is that working in an occupation in the \ncommunity builds credibility with those outside the church. In a \npost-Christian context, where people are skeptical of the church, it \nis important for non-Christians to see that church planters have jobs \nlike everyone else. In a time when Christianity doesn’t have the best \nreputation, it can provide significant “street-cred” with those outside \nthe church. \nFINANCIAL STABILITY\nAnother major benefit of bivocational or covocational ministry relates \nto the financial stability it provides in at least three different areas. \n1. THE PLANTER\nWhen the primary financial support comes from a marketplace \nsource rather than the church, there is usually less financial strain \non a family. This is especially true when the planter is employed \nfull-time in a vocation that provides benefits like insurance, vacation, \nand retirement. \n\n43\n2. THE CHURCH \nA church led by bivocational or covocational planters usually finds \nits financial base is much stronger. Without the need to provide full-\ntime salaries and benefits, the church can put more of its financial \nresources into ministry. \n3. THE CHURCH PLANTING ENTITY \nMany denominations plan to plant hundreds, if not thousands, of \nchurches over the next several years. Bivocational and covocational \nministry provides the opportunity for funding entities to embrace more \nsustainable church multiplication practices. This is especially necessary \nfor planters who are engaging in socioeconomically diverse contexts. \nMany traditional church plants start with a large annual budget \nsupported  by  multiple  funding  streams,  including  partnering  \nchurches and denominational entities. Because most funding models \nare structured over 3–5 years, it puts pressure on the planter to grow \nthe church quickly so it can become self-sustaining before funding \nruns out. The unfortunate reality is that a planter is often forced to \nattract financial givers rather than engaging in the brokenness in \ntheir community. Bivocational or covocational ministry provides a \nmore viable financial model that allows the planter to focus primarily \non mission. \nThis move towards planting more churches with bivocational or \ncovocational planters must start by rethinking vocation. We need \nto help people see that regardless of what God has called them to \ndo in the marketplace, their work matters and can align with God’s \nredemptive purposes. \n\n44"},"principle-9":{title:"Principle 9: ",hasContent:!0,content:"RETHINK TEAMS\n“In the New Testament there are functional distinctions \nbetween various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical \ndivision between clergy and laity.” —Howard Snyder\nThere is an adage that speaks to the importance of change in an \norganization. The saying goes, “We are perfectly designed to achieve \nwhat we are currently achieving.” If we apply this statement to the \nchurch, a question we might ask is: are we satisfied with what we \nare currently achieving? In other words, are we totally content with \nthe impact the church is having? If we are totally honest, the answer \nwould likely be a resounding no.\nIf we are perfectly designed to achieve what the church is currently \nachieving, then shouldn’t we ask if there is an issue in the way we \nare designed? Or at least question if there is an issue in the way we \nunderstand the nature of the church and its place in God’s mission? \nAre there “design” factors that we need to rethink to achieve the \noutcomes we desire?\n\n49\nPart of the solution is found in rethinking the nature of the church, \nmission, culture, multiplication, and vocation. However, I believe \nthere is also an organizational issue to be addressed. The church \nmust activate every member of the body. \nCLERGY-LAITY DIVIDE\nBefore we address how to look at the gifting and functions of the \nbody of Christ, let’s consider a general view of leadership that has \nkept the church from fully realizing its calling. I am referring to what \nis considered the clergy-laity divide. \nThe word laity comes from a Greek word laos, meaning “people of God.” \nToday we often use the related term “layperson” to distinguish from \n“professional.” A layperson is someone in a particular discipline who \nis seen as an “amateur” who dabbles in an area but doesn’t operate \nwith a high level of skill or expertise. The professional, on the other \nhand, is the expert. While there may be a place for this division in \nthe business world and sports, there is no biblical basis for such a \ndistinction in the church.\nAs Eugene Peterson writes\nWithin the Christian community there are few words that are \nmore disabling than “layperson” and “laity.” The words convey \nthe impression—an impression that quickly solidifies into a \nlie—that there is a two-level hierarchy among the men and \nwomen who follow Jesus. There are those who are trained, \nsometimes referred to as “the called,” the professionals who \nare paid to preach, teach, and provide guidance in the Christian \nway, occupying the upper level. The lower level is made up of \neveryone else, those whom God assigned jobs as storekeepers, \nlawyers, journalists, parents, and computer programmers.\n25\n\n50\nMinistry is not set aside for some professional class within the church. \nAll the people of God are called and commissioned. In The Community \nof the King, Howard Snyder speaks to this issue:\nThe New Testament doctrine of ministry rests not on the clergy-\nlaity distinction but on the twin and complementary pillars of \nthe priesthood of all believers and the gifts of the Spirit. Today, \nfour centuries after the Reformation, the full implications of this \nProtestant affirmation have yet to be worked out. The clergy-laity \ndichotomy is a direct carry-over from pre-Reformation Roman \nCatholicism and a throwback to the Old Testament priesthood. \nIt is one of the principal obstacles to the church effectively \nbeing God’s agent of the Kingdom today because it creates a \nfalse idea that only “holy men,” namely, ordained ministers, are \nreally qualified and responsible for leadership and significant \nministry. In the New Testament there are functional distinctions \nbetween various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical division \nbetween clergy and laity.\n26\nWe must “de-professionalize” ministry and give it back to the people of \nGod. However, this does not mean we don’t have leaders. Any signif-\nicant multiplication movement that makes an impact has definitive \nleadership, but we cannot confuse leadership with a call to participate \nin Jesus’ redemptive mission.\nWhen we look at the early church, we see that everyone is regarded as \na significant agent of the King and has a place in the unfolding of the \nmovement. In other words, in the church that Jesus built, everyone \ngets to play. In fact, everyone must play!\nTHE IMPORTANCE OF APEST\nSo if we are to activate all of God’s people for mission, how do we \naccomplish this task? Part of the solution to diminishing the clergy-laity \n\n51\ndivide and helping the laos engage in mission and ministry involves \nbroadening our concept of ministry. We need to move beyond ministry \nbeing framed simply by the traditional pastor-teacher model of the \nchurch to a fivefold understanding of ministry giftings as described \nin Ephesians 4:1-16. \nThis fivefold framework is often referred to as APEST: apostle, prophet, \nevangelist, shepherd, and teacher. Most of the time, Ephesians 4 is \nviewed as a leadership text. In other words, we understand the gifts \nmentioned as leaders given to the church for the purpose of equipping \nthe people of God. However, Ephesians 4 is about the ministry of the \nchurch. It is a body of Christ text. Paul is stating that the gifts given to \nthe church are given to the laos—the whole people of God.\nAt the heart of this letter is Paul’s understanding and description of \nthe essential ministry of the church. Consider it this way:\n• In Ephesians 4:1-6, Paul calls us to realize our fundamental \nunity in the one God.\n• In Ephesians 4:7-11, he says that APEST has been given to the \nchurch by Christ.\n• In Ephesians 4:12-16, he says why APEST is given to build up, \nreach unity, and become mature.\nPaul outlines in simple terms the core ministries that make up the \nbody of Christ. He clearly states that Christ has given certain gifts to \neach one and distributed them throughout the body as He sees fit. \nThe ministry of the church is unmistakably stated as being at least \nfivefold in form through expression in the giftings of apostle, prophet, \nevangelist, shepherd, and teacher. And it is through the diversity of \nAPEST that the church can operate in the fullness of Christ. \n\n52\nThe word equip in verse 12 is an interesting word choice. It was often \nused to describe the setting of a broken bone or alignment. Paul is \nsaying that each of the ministries within APEST add to the ability \nof the entire body to function properly. Our ability to grow, mature, \nand become the church that Jesus intended is directly linked to the \nministries within APEST. \nSadly, most churches operate with only two out of the five: shepherding \nand teaching. In most cases, the ministries of the apostle, prophet, and \nevangelist have been minimized, if not completely relegated to the \nmargins. When we do this, we essentially cut off three-fifths of our \ncapacity to grow and mature as the body of Christ. This has damaged \nthe church’s ability to be the fullness of Jesus in the world.\nAPEST SUMMARY\nHere are summaries of each APEST ministry. \nAPOSTLE: SENT AND EXTENDS\nThe word apostle literally means “sent one.” The Latin form is missio, \nwhich is where we get the English word mission. The apostle is most \nresponsible to activate, develop, and protect the missionary sentness \nof the church. This sent quality gives the apostle’s life a catalytic \ninfluence, often playing the role of an entrepreneur at the forefront \nof new ventures. They are the cultural architects who are concerned \nwith the overall extension of Christianity throughout society. Because \nof this, they are often drawn to issues related to design, systems, and \noverarching organizational structures. They have a missional focus \nto their ministry.\nPROPHET: QUESTIONS AND REFORMS\nProphets are sensitive to God and what is important to Him. They \noften sense what truth needs to be emphasized for their time and \n\n53\nplace. Prophets are guardians of the covenant relationship. Whether \nit is in the church, society, or an organizational setting, prophets are \nquick to recognize the gap between “what is” and “what should be.” \nThe weight of this tension leads prophets to question the status quo \nas well as initiate efforts for reform. Ultimately, they are not satisfied \nuntil they see a “closing of the gap” between God’s demands and our \ncovenantal faithfulness. This desire to see the truth of God’s reality \nfleshed out in concrete and tangible ways gives an incarnational \nquality to their ministry.\nEVANGELIST: RECRUITS AND GATHERS\nEvangelists communicate the message of the gospel in joyous, infec-\ntious ways. They enjoy meeting new people and wooing them into \na friendship. They are avid communicators of ideas and often share \ntheir thoughts and feelings in convincing ways. They are recruiters to \nthe cause and find fulfillment in helping people get caught up into the \ndriving narrative of the church—the gospel of the kingdom. As bearers \nof good news, they have an attractional quality to their ministry.\nSHEPHERD: PROTECTS AND PROVIDES\nShepherds protect the community from danger and provide for its \nneeds on both an individual and communal level. They notice when \npeople are alone or hurting and feel drawn to nurture the spiritual \nand communal health of the church. They are loyal to the organization \nand the people within it. They ensure the community is experienced \nas a safe and loving environment, giving their ministry a distinctly \ncommunal focus.\nTEACHER: UNDERSTANDS AND EXPLAINS\nTeachers find great satisfaction in helping people learn truth and \nwisdom. They grasp complex, systemic truths then help people \nunderstand them. They often formulate curriculum and pathways \n\n54\nof learning. They ensure the truths of Scripture are passed from \ngeneration to generation. Their ministry could be summarized as \ninstructional in nature.\n27\nAPEST AND MULTIPLYING CHURCHES\nWhen considering the importance of developing a team, it is essential \nto note that there isn’t a single solution for every context. However, \ndeveloping a multiplying church that is effectively engaging its context \nwill no doubt involve team dynamics that are informed by the fivefold \ntypology of Ephesians 4. \nPractically speaking, how do you incorporate APEST into the devel-\nopment of a team?  \n1. Understand your gifts considering APEST because it will \ninfluence where you focus your ministry. Example: A teacher \nwill focus on a Sunday gathering to teach. \n2. Understand the makeup of your team and recognize what \ngifts may be missing. If you are a gifted shepherd, you need \nsomeone apostolic or you will never start something new. But \nlikewise, if you are apostolic, you must have a shepherd or you \nwill likely push people too hard and run the risk of burnout.\n3. Determine how each gift will have equal input into the mission \nand ministry of the church. Remember that a key aspect of \nEphesians 4 is that the church will not reach maturity unless \nall five gifts are activated and exercised. \n4. Determine how to ensure the equipping of the saints. How will \nyou encourage and empower those with the gift of teaching to \nequip other teachers? How will those who have an apostolic \ncalling fan the flame of other sent ones? How will the evan-\ngelist equip others who have an evangelistic calling?\n\n55\n5. Measure success. How will you measure success from an \nAPEST perspective? How can APEST become a mark of the \nchurch? \nIf these are functions of the community, here is one way to frame \nmeasuring language to determine how the church is doing in each \narea:\n• A: missional impact \n• P: covenant faithfulness \n• E: gospel proclamation \n• S: reconciled community \n• T: deep wisdom\nRemember, a church that can bring together, encourage, and capture \nthe gifting of a fully functioning team will succeed in whatever it is \nseeking to achieve. APEST adds a necessary ingredient to the overall \nmissional fitness and maturity of the church but must be informed \nand shaped by the others to anchor the church in the fullness of \nChrist’s nature and mission.\nPOSSIBLE OBJECTIONS\nAmid conversations surrounding APEST, there are occasionally ques-\ntions regarding the significance of Ephesians 4. Some will ask, “Are \nwe putting too much emphasis on APEST, especially when it seems \nto be based on one passage of Scripture?” A second question often \nincludes the other gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians and Romans 12. \nPeople ask why the gifts in Ephesians 4 are given prominence over \ngifts mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament.\n\n56\nThe following responses should help address concerns you may have \nwhen considering APEST.\n1. Biblical commentators have long-held Ephesians as a consti-\ntutional document of the church. Like all constitutions, it is \nmeant to guide subsequent thinking and action in the orga-\nnization. The book represents the best way to think about the \nchurch—at least how Paul understood it.\n2. Ephesians 4:1-16 presents a promise that no other passage of \nScripture claims: maturity and fullness of Christ (vv. 11-16). \nIf we desire unity (vv. 1-6) and strive for maturity (vv. 11-16), \nthen it is difficult to discount the connection point between \nunity and maturity with the diversity of gifts given by Christ \nin verses 7-11. \n3. Ephesians  4  is  not  the  only  passage  in  which  APEST  is  \nmentioned.\n• Apostle is used over 80 times in the New Testament.\n• Prophet is used nearly 800 times in Scripture, over 150 \ntimes in the New Testament.\n• Evangelist is used in Acts and 2 Timothy.\n• Shepherd is used 23 times in the New Testament.\n• Teacher is used 129 times in the New Testament.\n• The word pastor, which we have no problem using as \nthe catch-all for leadership, is used once, and it is in \nEphesians 4. \n4. If you struggle to think about these gifts as personal callings \nor vocations (they are certainly not roles or offices), then at \nleast consider them as communal functions of the church. \n\n57\nShould the church be apostolic? Prophetic? Evangelistic? Is \nthe church to be a shepherding and teaching community? The \nanswer to each of these questions is a resounding yes! These \nfive functions should define what the church does.\n5. The key word in 1 Corinthians is “manifestations” or gifts of \nthe Spirit. The gifts are tools given to execute the calling. The \nkey word in Romans 12 is “praxis,” which is skill-based, while \nEphesians 4 are callings given to the body by Jesus. The callings \nin Ephesians 4 are the people. Think of them as how we are \nwired instead of spiritual gifts given to a person. Compare the \ndistinction between the passages to being a carpenter. If my \ncalling is to be a carpenter, I am wired and gifted at carpentry \nwork. However, as a carpenter I have several tools that I will \nuse including a level, saw, hammer, and router.\nOr consider the spiritual gift of hospitality. Someone wired as \na shepherd may provide hospitality as they desire to welcome \npeople into their home. But someone wired apostolically may \nbe hospitable because they want to start something new and \nwelcome others into that new adventure. The gift is the same, \nbut the motivation is different.\n6. Recognize the gifts are given to the church at Jesus’ ascension. \nWhy, in His ascension, does Jesus bestow the fivefold approach \non the church? \n• We   become   equipped,   perfected,   or   completed                  \n(Ephesians 4:12).\n• We can live out the unity described in Ephesians 4:1-6 \n(Ephesians 4:13).\n• We grow into maturity, so we attain the fullness of Christ \n(Ephesians 4:13).\n\n58\n• We are not given to theological fads or deception and \nwill stand firm (Ephesians 4:14).\n• We grow up into Christ, our head (Ephesians 4:15).\n• We will be rightly ordered in our relationship to our \nhead and to each other as His body (Ephesians 4:15-16).\n7. Consider APEST to be broader than Ephesians 4. Some would \nargue that we can actually see APEST in the created order, \nnot just the church. In other words, APEST is laced by God \nthroughout His creation. Are there teachers in society? Shep-\nherds? Evangelists? \nFurther, and this is incredibly significant, APEST is incorporated \nfully  into  the  life  of  Jesus.  He  is  the  perfect  archetype  of  each  \ngift.  He  is  the  ultimate  Apostle,  the  perfect  Prophet,  the  good  \nnews  Evangelist,  the  Good  Shepherd,  and  the  great  Teacher.       \n\n59"},rethink:{title:"Principle 8: RETHINK",hasContent:!0,content:"MULTIPLICATION\n“Movement occurs when the making of mis-\nsion-shaped disciples—who live in the world for the \nsake  of  the  world,  in  the  way  of  Christ—goes  viral.”                                       \n—J.R. Woodward and Dan White, Jr.\nIn 1,000 Churches by Ed Stetzer and Daniel Im, they discuss rapid repro-\nduction of churches and compare the gestation periods of elephants \nand rabbits. Elephants carry one calf for a gestation period of nearly \ntwo years then nurse it for three years after birth before reproducing \nagain. On the other hand, rabbits carry a litter of typically 14 babies \nfor just one month. Then, in a matter of minutes after giving birth, that \nrabbit can become pregnant again, repeating the cycle. There may be \na time and a place when an elephant-type approach is appropriate in \nthe church. But if our goal is rapid church multiplication, then we must \nstrive toward a movement that, as the saying goes, “breeds like rabbits.”\n21\n  \nMULTIPLICATION IS A MINDSET\nPerhaps the first thing that should be said regarding church planting \nand movements is that it has to be a mindset. We must have a “rabbit” \n\n45\nkind of mentality that will not only change the way we think about \nchurch, mission, and multiplication, but it will begin to shape the \nvery way we function as the church.\nAlbert Einstein’s famous quote rings true here, “We can’t solve prob-\nlems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created \nthem.” If we apply that to the church, then, “We cannot solve the \nproblems of the church by using the same kind of thinking we used \nwhen we created those problems in the first place.” We can’t keep \nthinking and doing what we have already done and expect different \nresults. We must rethink how we understand and live out the life of \nthe church if we wish to see a multiplication movement.\nMake it a discipline to think movement, not institution. If you identify \nyourself as a movement, then you will eventually start acting like one.\nTHE MAKEUP OF A                     \nMULTIPLICATION MOVEMENT\nWhat are the tangible characteristics of multiplying churches? Here \nare four aspects that contribute to a movement culture.\n1. GOD’S MISSION IS CENTRAL. \nA church that is focused on real movement has a strong emphasis \non the missio Dei. It is God who has a mission to set things right in a \nbroken world, to redeem and restore it to what He always intended. \nA movement church understands that mission is not the invention, \nresponsibility, or program of the church. Instead, they see that mission \nflows directly from the character and purposes of a missionary God.\nA multiplying church not only understands that the mission is God’s \nbut also recognizes that His mission is larger than their individual \nchurch. They live out the reality that God’s primary activity is in the \n\n46\nworld and that their responsibility is to be sent into the world to \nparticipate in what He is already doing. As a result, the church does not \nsimply send missionaries. They view their church as the missionary.\n2. ALL OF GOD’S PEOPLE ARE \nACTIVATED. \nMultiplication movements only succeed when they equip all of God’s \npeople. Every believer has potential to change the world. This transfor-\nmation occurs more often through the ordinary than the extraordinary. \nOur job as church leaders is to bring it out. As Tim Keller describes \nthis movement, “In every seed is the potential for a tree, and in every \ntree the potential for a forest, but all of this is contained in the initial \nseed.”\n22\n In a movement church, everyone gets to play. No one sits on \nthe bench.\n3. ADAPTIVE LEADERSHIP AND        \nADAPTIVE STRUCTURES\nA movement church has leadership that knows how to move a church \nand keep it moving. This type of leadership highlights apostolic and \nprophetic roles. The apostolic person leads with a positive vision of what \ncan be, while the prophetic tends to call the status quo into question.\nMultiplication needs adaptive leadership, people who can help the \nchurch transition to a different, nimbler version of itself. Such leaders \ndon’t necessarily have to be highly creative innovators, but they must \nbe people who can move the church into adaptive modes capable of \ntackling adaptive challenges. These people create the conditions for \nchange and innovation. \nIn movement-focused churches, the effectiveness of the leaders is \nnot measured by what they accomplish but by how the people of \nGod are equipped, organized, and inspired to participate in God’s \n\n47\nmission in the world. This leadership and structure is geared toward \ndisciple-making. In the makeup of a movement, discipleship is the \nengine for everything. Without it, the church will drift away from \nits core calling.\nAs J.R. Woodward and Dan White write: \nMovement occurs when the making of mission-shaped disci-\nples—who live in the world for the sake of the world, in the way \nof Christ—goes viral. Movement is about developing structures \nand systems that catapult people into mission, where repro-\nducing discipleship groups, missional communities, churches \nand networks of churches is a natural part of its DNA. It’s the \nripple effect: throwing a rock into a pond creates one ripple and \nthen another and another, till ripples cover the whole pond.\n23\n 4. APEST, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE A \nWe will examine APEST in principle 9, but for a quick summary, \nit denotes the roles of apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and \nteacher in Ephesians 4. Keller notes that all APEST ministries are vital, \nbut the apostolic role leads to movement. As Keller writes, “This is \nnot an emphasis of importance or priority; it is one of purpose and \ndesign.”\n24\n Apostolic people push against current boundaries and \npropel Christianity into new areas. If you remove apostolic leaders, \nyou won’t see multiplication movement.  \n\n48"},"rethink-scorecards":{title:"Principle 12: Rethink Scorecards",hasContent:!0,content:"Conclusion: Think Long Haul, Not Quick Fix \n05\n08\n12\n17\n25\n31\n36\n39\n44\n48\n59\n68\n74\n82\n\nStarting a church? \nWe’ll help.\nReliable, free resources, featuring world-class teachers\nSTART HERE\nNewChurches.com\n\x1f \n@NewChurches\n\n5\nINTRODUCTION \n“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who \ncannot read and write, but those who cannot learn,       \nunlearn, and relearn.” —Alvin Toffler \nWhen bringing about change in the way people behave, we often \nneed to start with questions of “why” before considering the practical \nissues of “how.” In the book Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire \nEveryone to Take Action, Simon Sinek contends that there are two \nprimary ways to influence human behavior: you can either manip-\nulate it or inspire it.
