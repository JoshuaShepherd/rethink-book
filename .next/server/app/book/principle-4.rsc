# PRINCIPLE 4: RETHINK MISSIO DEI

“The main business of many mission committees is to
determine how to spend the mission budget rather than
view the entire congregational budget as an exercise in
mission.” —Darrell Guder
The fourth **missiological** principle is the concept of ****missio Dei**. An
English rendering of this Latin phrase speaks to the “mission of God.”
It is God who has a mission to set things right in a broken, sinful world,
to redeem and restore it to what He has always intended.
Mission is not the invention, responsibility, or program of the church.
Instead, mission flows directly from the character and purposes of a
missionary God. In the words of David Bosch, “It is not the church which
‘undertakes’ mission; it is the **missio Dei** which constitutes the church.”8
It is not only crucial to understand that God has a mission but equally
important to understand that His mission is larger than the church.
We in the church often wrongly assume that the primary activity
of God is in the church, rather than recognizing that God’s primary
activity is in the world and that the church is God’s instrument sent
into the world to participate in His redemptive mission.
Before discussing how to live out a **missio Dei** theology in a practical
manner, let’s consider how the first four **missiological** principles
cohere together. Remember, the first two principles reminded us that
we are a sent missionary people. The third principle instructs that
we are to incarnate or embed our lives and the gospel into the local
context we have been sent. **missio Dei**, then, simply states that God
is already at work in the lives around us and our job is to figure out
what God is doing and how He wants us to participate.
## G O D ’ S M I S S I O N A S T H E O R G A N I Z I N G
# P R I N C I P L E
A **missio Dei** perspective will shape our thinking in the manner we
understand the form and function of the church. Typically, congre­
gations view “missions” as simply one program or activity among
many other equally important functions of the church. Therefore,
the missions program is seen alongside that of worship, small groups,
men’s and women’s ministries, youth and children’s ministries, and
so forth. When missions is viewed in this way, the business of many
mission committees “is to determine how to spend the mission budget
rather than view the entire congregational budget as an exercise in
mission.”9 However, when the church begins to define itself as an
agent of God’s mission, it will begin to organize every activity of the
church around the **missio Dei**.
Mission as the organizing principle means that mission goes
way beyond being some sort of optional activity or program
for our churches. It actually is the organizing axis of the church.
The life of the church revolves around it. This is not to say
that we don’t do corporate worship, develop community, and
make disciples, but that these are catalyzed by and organized
around the mission function. Only in this way can we be truly
**missional**. Merely adding serving events or special outreach
days to our church schedules will not develop **missional** people
nor make a **missional** church.10
To ensure clarity on this issue of God’s mission as the organizing
# principle for all activities of the church, let me state again that this
does not minimize the need for and importance of the other functions
of the church. It is simply stating that no other function of the church
can rightly be the organizing principle or the reason we come together
in the first place. Worship should not be the organizing principle.
Community should not be the organizing principle. Even evangelism
should not be the organizing principle.
Instead, worship, community, **discipleship**, evangelism, and every
other important activity of the church are properly understood and
initiated only when viewed through the lens of mission. Pause for a
moment and examine the image below.
The first image represents some activities of a local church. Most
churches have ministries for arts or worship, children, small groups,
youth, and so forth. However, one of the problems with a list like this,
is that “missions” becomes just one activity of the church, alongside
several other equally important aspects. These images illustrate the

VS.

move from “missions” as one among many functions of the church
to “mission” being the organizing principle for all other activities or
ministries of the church.11
If we believe the church is really all about God’s mission, then God’s
mission should inform everything else we do as a church. As the
second image shows, we should remove the “s” of missions and put
mission at the top to illustrate that the **missio Dei** should shape, or at
least influence, every other program and activity of the church.
# G O D ’ S M I S S I O N A S T H E
# S TA R T I N G P O I N T
Determining where and how we engage in God’s mission is the
second way a **missio Dei** theology influences our activity. If the
mission is God’s, and it is, then how do we step into it? How do we
truly participate in what God is doing? Geoffrey Harris provides
these helpful words:
The average church member may be reassured to know
that mission is instigated by the simple act of praying, and
of listening to God, and following God’s guidance. In such
fundamental activities all Christians can participate. In addi­
tion, it is reassuring to know that God’s Spirit is at work in the
world prior to our engagement in any relationship or any
work of mission. The presence of God in the world means that
anyone embarking upon God’s mission already has an ally
and accomplice in the work. It becomes “mission alongside”
rather than mission alone.12
# F O U R S T E P S T O WA R D
# M I S S I O N A L E N G A G E M E N T
Practically speaking, what does it look like to do mission alongside
what God is already doing? If it is God’s mission and not ours, how
do we know where, when, and how to participate? The answer, at
least in part, is that we must look for God’s activity in a local setting
as the place to begin our **missional** engagement. Let me introduce
one way to determine what God’s local mission is and how a church
body can begin to participate in it.
# 1. DISCOVER
If it is truly God’s mission and not ours, then we must first discover
how God is at work. The first step in discovering what God is doing is
through listening. Individually and collectively, we must cultivate our
ability to listen well on three fronts: to the Spirit, to the local community,
and to each other. It is impossible to ascertain the movement of God
without carving out significant time to listen to His voice through
prayer and Scripture, as well as the voices of those we desire to serve.
If the first step is about discovering, then the first question must be,
“What is God doing in this place?”
Mission cannot be decided beforehand. It must be decided in relation
to God’s activity in a local context. Instead of front-loading mission
strategies with what we think a community needs, we begin by
listening and learning what God is already doing. Only after discov­
ering what God is doing in a particular setting do we then ask how
He wants us to participate.
# 2. DISCERN
In addition to listening, participating in God’s mission will involve
discernment. Not only will we need to discover what God is already
doing, but we will need to ask the follow-up question, “In light of our
gifts and resources, how does God want us to participate in what He is
doing?” The fact is that we can’t do it all, which is true for both individual
followers of Jesus as well as local congregations. But it is also true that
God has gifted us all to do something! The point of discernment is to
determine where and how to participate in God’s mission.
## 3. DO
This may seem obvious, but the processes of discovery and discern­
ment are useless if we do not obey what God is calling us to do. We
must acknowledge that following Jesus will often be costly. Therefore,
we need to ask, “Will we be obedient to costly discernment?” Or will
we put conditions on our obedience? Someone once said that you
shouldn’t ask God to guide your steps if you are not willing to move
your feet.
# 4. DEBRIEF
Throughout the process of engaging God’s mission, we must create
opportunities to reflect on our **missional** involvement. Sometimes this
may simply mean we need individual “down time” to reflect upon
our activities. We may need to ask God to affirm our involvement or
to ask for clarity. But it will also mean carving out time to reflect with
others among our faith community. We need to hear what others are
seeing and sensing concerning God’s activities and to hear the stories
of how others are engaging God’s mission. It is important for us to
offer feedback on what we are sensing.
These four steps toward **missional** engagement help to put emphasis
on the context God has sent us to and on how God has already been
working in that place long before we ever arrived.18:["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-4xl","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mdx-content prose prose-lg md:prose-xl prose-slate dark:prose-invert mx-auto prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-h1:text-4xl prose-h1:mb-8 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h2:mt-12 prose-h2:mb-6 prose-h3:text-xl prose-h3:mt-8 prose-h3:mb-4 prose-p:text-lg prose-p:leading-8 prose-p:mb-6 prose-strong:text-blue-600 dark:prose-strong:text-blue-400 prose-em:text-gray-600 dark:prose-em:text-gray-400 prose-li:text-lg prose-li:leading-8 prose-li:mb-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-blue-500 prose-blockquote:bg-blue-50/50 dark:prose-blockquote:bg-blue-950/20 prose-blockquote:px-6 prose-blockquote:py-4 prose-blockquote:rounded-r-lg max-w-none","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed [&>*:first-child]:mt-0","children":"$1a"}]}]}]
