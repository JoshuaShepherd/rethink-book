# PRINCIPLE 11: RETHINK FLOW

“If we fail at engaging well and living as Christ would live
among our neighbors and friends, we fail as missionaries
and the culture doesn’t see the visible beauty of the sent
church.” —Hugh Halter
Traditionally, we start with church then disciple people and send them
on mission if we want to see **multiplication**. But, in a post-Christian
context, we must start with **discipleship** and mission then work
toward church. The most effective approach to **multiplication** is to
begin with missionary activity.
This is what is meant by the phrase missionary flow. It’s a simple way
to rethink the flow or direction of starting a new church. We need
a new framework, a new way to think about planting that doesn’t
begin with Sunday.28

Let’s consider each circle individually.
# E N G A G I N G C O N T E X T
Too often church **multiplication** starts with Christians from another
church or they gather disconnected believers from around a city.
This is well-intentioned and might be better than nothing at all, but
in most cases, this is simply starting a church with a church. This is
not what we are talking about with missionary flow. Missionary flow
means starting from scratch.
The first phase of any mission must involve contextualization, under­
standing the local setting so you can best engage people relationally.
Along with understanding the context, we need to remember that
we are a sent, missionary people. In other words, we have already
been sent into our neighborhoods. We have already been sent to our
workplaces. We have already been sent to the social spaces we inhabit
each day. We don’t have to wait, wondering where God might send
us. Instead, we already live, work, and play in these places for the
purpose of God’s mission.
This is where our church **multiplication** efforts need to start. We must
identify the places and people to whom God has sent us. Incarnate
into those places. Pray and listen for what God is doing. Discern how
He wants us to participate as we begin to understand, relate to, and
connect with people. Start with **discipleship** and mission and work
toward church.
# C U LT I VAT I N G C O M M U N I T Y
The word cultivating speaks to the idea of nurturing. When we culti­
vate soil, we prepare it for planting. We have no power to make crops
grow, but we can nurture conditions that will increase the likelihood
for growth. Cultivating community is similar. We can’t make commu­
nity happen, but we can create opportunities and environments in
which community can flourish.
We use the word community to make a distinction from the more
customary word church. Cultivating community involves creating
time and space for people to connect relationally with you but also
with each other. The key is that this space is not seen as a church
but instead as a place where relationships are developed. When
relationships begin to develop, you are building “social momentum.”
Examine the updated missionary flow and notice two additional
phrases and arrows.
Engaging
Context
Social Momentum
Spiritual Momentum
Community
# S O C I A L M O M E N T U M
Social momentum creates spaces for Christians and non-Christians
to connect, do life together, and build relational equity before they
consider attending a church. Unless we create a consistent, gathering
environment—between engaging context and structuring congre­
gation—that people can be invited to and be part of, we will never
experience social momentum in our missionary engagement.
Here is another way to think about it. Most church planters are good
at engaging context. They work at getting to know their neighbors.
They are intentional about making connections in coffee shops or at
the gym. They pay careful attention at their workplaces for oppor­
tunities to make friends with coworkers. However, if there isn’t an
ongoing, somewhat informal “get-together” for the planter to invite
people to, they will simply have lots of surface connections that never
move beyond being acquaintances. After making connections with
new people, many church planters don’t have a clear vision of what
to do next relationally. Too often, the step taken is to start a Sunday
morning worship service so there is a church activity to which new
people can be invited.
Now, there is certainly nothing wrong with inviting people to church,
but in a missionary context, we need to consider an intermediate or
in-between relational step. There must be regular, relational spaces to
which we can easily and naturally invite people. Without a consistent
space to welcome the people we have met while engaging in our
context, we will never develop social momentum. Instead, we will
simply have relational connections that never move beyond knowing
each other by name.
So, what do those relational spaces look like? We need to find some­
thing we are already doing, or at least like to do, and develop a
consistent rhythm where we can easily invite someone to join. For
example, maybe you have a fire pit in your backyard that you light
every Saturday night. Maybe it is a game night once a week or once a
month in your home. Schedule a neighborhood potluck once a month.
Sharing meals is always a great idea.
The point is that when you have an ongoing relational event, it is
natural to invite those you are trying to connect with. You could say
to a coworker or neighbor, “Hey, on the first Saturday night of every
month, we have a group of friends over to roast hot dogs and make
s’mores around the fire pit. You are always welcome to join us.”
Creating time and space to develop social momentum will provide a
necessary opportunity for Christians and non-Christians to begin the
process of cultivating community within a neighborhood or network.
# S P I R I T U A L M O M E N T U M
Now, back to missionary flow.
The new arrow coming out of cultivating community is spiritual
momentum. Much like developing social momentum, we need to
think about creating time and space but, in this case, to provide
opportunities for people to grow spiritually.
Engaging
Context
Community
It may be as simple as gathering to pray for one another, read through
the Gospels, or discuss what Scripture says regarding current events.
If we are truly doing life with unbelievers and developing social
momentum, then there will be those who desire deeper, more mean­
ingful conversations. It should be natural and easy to say to someone
that you have a group of friends that meet once a week to pray for
each other and talk about spiritual things.
If we are starting with and connecting exclusively with non-Christians,
the group that provides spiritual momentum may be something brand
new. In other words, it may be formed directly out of the time and
space created to develop social momentum. However, if we have a
group of Christians who are a part of a church planting team, this
spiritual momentum group may be a **missional** community to which
we invite that person.
# S T R U C T U R I N G C O N G R E G AT I O N
The final circle is structuring congregation. There will come a time
to form or structure a congregation. There will be many issues to
consider, such as governance, meeting rhythms, administration,
budgets, staffing, and so forth.
Don’t forget that we are talking about the importance of thinking like
a missionary. Church **multiplication** is the outworking of mission and
community. Structuring a congregation is the outworking of engaging
context and cultivating community. Church **multiplication** is the point
where mission and community intersect. At the heart of God’s plan
to bless the nations are the people of God. The church is formed by
mission and is formed for mission.18:["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-4xl","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mdx-content prose prose-lg md:prose-xl prose-slate dark:prose-invert mx-auto prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-h1:text-4xl prose-h1:mb-8 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h2:mt-12 prose-h2:mb-6 prose-h3:text-xl prose-h3:mt-8 prose-h3:mb-4 prose-p:text-lg prose-p:leading-8 prose-p:mb-6 prose-strong:text-blue-600 dark:prose-strong:text-blue-400 prose-em:text-gray-600 dark:prose-em:text-gray-400 prose-li:text-lg prose-li:leading-8 prose-li:mb-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-blue-500 prose-blockquote:bg-blue-50/50 dark:prose-blockquote:bg-blue-950/20 prose-blockquote:px-6 prose-blockquote:py-4 prose-blockquote:rounded-r-lg max-w-none","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed [&>*:first-child]:mt-0","children":"$1a"}]}]}]
