# PRINCIPLE 9: RETHINK TEAMS

“In the New Testament there are functional distinctions
between various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical
division between clergy and laity.” —Howard Snyder
There is an adage that speaks to the importance of change in an
organization. The saying goes, “We are perfectly designed to achieve
what we are currently achieving.” If we apply this statement to the
church, a question we might ask is: are we satisfied with what we
are currently achieving? In other words, are we totally content with
the impact the church is having? If we are totally honest, the answer
would likely be a resounding no.
If we are perfectly designed to achieve what the church is currently
achieving, then shouldn’t we ask if there is an issue in the way we
are designed? Or at least question if there is an issue in the way we
understand the nature of the church and its place in God’s mission?
Are there “design” factors that we need to rethink to achieve the
outcomes we desire?
Part of the solution is found in rethinking the nature of the church,
mission, culture, **multiplication**, and vocation. However, I believe
there is also an organizational issue to be addressed. The church
must activate every member of the body.
# C L E R G Y- L A I T Y D I V I D E
Before we address how to look at the gifting and functions of the
body of Christ, let’s consider a general view of leadership that has
kept the church from fully realizing its calling. I am referring to what
is considered the clergy-laity divide.
The word laity comes from a Greek word laos, meaning “people of God.”
Today we often use the related term “layperson” to distinguish from
“professional.” A layperson is someone in a particular discipline who
is seen as an “amateur” who dabbles in an area but doesn’t operate
with a high level of skill or expertise. The professional, on the other
hand, is the expert. While there may be a place for this division in
the business world and sports, there is no biblical basis for such a
distinction in the church.
As Eugene Peterson writes
Within the Christian community there are few words that are
more disabling than “layperson” and “laity.” The words convey
the impression—an impression that quickly solidifies into a
lie—that there is a two-level hierarchy among the men and
women who follow Jesus. There are those who are trained,
sometimes referred to as “the called,” the professionals who
are paid to preach, teach, and provide guidance in the Christian
way, occupying the upper level. The lower level is made up of
everyone else, those whom God assigned jobs as storekeepers,
lawyers, journalists, parents, and computer programmers.25
Ministry is not set aside for some professional class within the church.
All the people of God are called and commissioned. In The Community
of the *King*, Howard Snyder speaks to this issue:
The New Testament doctrine of ministry rests not on the clergy-
laity distinction but on the twin and complementary pillars of
the priesthood of all believers and the gifts of the Spirit. Today,
four centuries after the Reformation, the full implications of this
Protestant affirmation have yet to be worked out. The clergy-laity
dichotomy is a direct carry-over from pre-Reformation Roman
Catholicism and a throwback to the Old Testament priesthood.
It is one of the principal obstacles to the church effectively
being God’s agent of the Kingdom today because it creates a
false idea that only “holy men,” namely, ordained ministers, are
really qualified and responsible for leadership and significant
ministry. In the New Testament there are functional distinctions
between various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical division
between clergy and laity.26
We must “de-professionalize” ministry and give it back to the people of
God. However, this does not mean we don’t have leaders. Any signif­
icant **multiplication** movement that makes an impact has definitive
leadership, but we cannot confuse leadership with a call to participate
in Jesus’ redemptive mission.
When we look at the early church, we see that everyone is regarded as
a significant agent of the King and has a place in the unfolding of the
movement. In other words, in the church that Jesus built, everyone
gets to play. In fact, everyone must play!
# T H E I M P O R TA N C E O F A P E S T
So if we are to activate all of God’s people for mission, how do we
accomplish this task? Part of the solution to diminishing the clergy-laity
divide and helping the laos engage in mission and ministry involves
broadening our concept of ministry. We need to move beyond ministry
being framed simply by the traditional pastor-teacher model of the
church to a fivefold understanding of ministry giftings as described
in Ephesians 4:1-16.
This fivefold framework is often referred to as ****APEST****: apostle, prophet,
evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. Most of the time, Ephesians 4 is
viewed as a leadership text. In other words, we understand the gifts
mentioned as leaders given to the church for the purpose of equipping
the people of God. However, Ephesians 4 is about the ministry of the
church. It is a body of Christ text. Paul is stating that the gifts given to
the church are given to the laos—the whole people of God.
At the heart of this letter is Paul’s understanding and description of
the essential ministry of the church. Consider it this way:
•	 In Ephesians 4:1-6, Paul calls us to realize our fundamental
unity in the one God.
•	 In Ephesians 4:7-11, he says that ****APEST**** has been given to the
church by Christ.
•	 In Ephesians 4:12-16, he says why ****APEST**** is given to build up,
reach unity, and become mature.
Paul outlines in simple terms the core ministries that make up the
body of Christ. He clearly states that Christ has given certain gifts to
each one and distributed them throughout the body as He sees fit.
The ministry of the church is unmistakably stated as being at least
fivefold in form through expression in the giftings of apostle, prophet,
evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. And it is through the diversity of
****APEST**** that the church can operate in the fullness of Christ.
The word equip in verse 12 is an interesting word choice. It was often
used to describe the setting of a broken bone or alignment. Paul is
saying that each of the ministries within ****APEST**** add to the ability
of the entire body to function properly. Our ability to grow, mature,
and become the church that Jesus intended is directly linked to the
ministries within ****APEST****.
Sadly, most churches operate with only two out of the five: shepherding
and teaching. In most cases, the ministries of the apostle, prophet, and
evangelist have been minimized, if not completely relegated to the
margins. When we do this, we essentially cut off three-fifths of our
capacity to grow and mature as the body of Christ. This has damaged
the church’s ability to be the fullness of Jesus in the world.
# A P E S T S U M M A R Y
Here are summaries of each ****APEST**** ministry.
# APOSTLE: SENT AND EXTENDS
The word apostle literally means “sent one.” The Latin form is missio,
which is where we get the English word mission. The apostle is most
responsible to activate, develop, and protect the missionary sentness
of the church. This sent quality gives the apostle’s life a catalytic
influence, often playing the role of an entrepreneur at the forefront
of new ventures. They are the cultural architects who are concerned
with the overall extension of Christianity throughout society. Because
of this, they are often drawn to issues related to design, systems, and
overarching organizational structures. They have a **missional** focus
to their ministry.
# PROPHET: QUESTIONS AND REFORMS
Prophets are sensitive to God and what is important to Him. They
often sense what truth needs to be emphasized for their time and
place. Prophets are guardians of the covenant relationship. Whether
it is in the church, society, or an organizational setting, prophets are
quick to recognize the gap between “what is” and “what should be.”
The weight of this tension leads prophets to question the status quo
as well as initiate efforts for reform. Ultimately, they are not satisfied
until they see a “closing of the gap” between God’s demands and our
covenantal faithfulness. This desire to see the truth of God’s reality
fleshed out in concrete and tangible ways gives an **incarnational**
quality to their ministry.
# EVANGELIST: RECRUITS AND GATHERS
Evangelists communicate the message of the gospel in joyous, infec­
tious ways. They enjoy meeting new people and wooing them into
a friendship. They are avid communicators of ideas and often share
their thoughts and feelings in convincing ways. They are recruiters to
the cause and find fulfillment in helping people get caught up into the
driving narrative of the church—the gospel of the kingdom. As bearers
of good news, they have an attractional quality to their ministry.
# SHEPHERD: PROTECTS AND PROVIDES
Shepherds protect the community from danger and provide for its
needs on both an individual and communal level. They notice when
people are alone or hurting and feel drawn to nurture the spiritual
and communal health of the church. They are loyal to the organization
and the people within it. They ensure the community is experienced
as a safe and loving environment, giving their ministry a distinctly
communal focus.
# TEACHER: UNDERSTANDS AND EXPLAINS
Teachers find great satisfaction in helping people learn truth and
wisdom. They grasp complex, systemic truths then help people
understand them. They often formulate curriculum and pathways
of learning. They ensure the truths of Scripture are passed from
generation to generation. Their ministry could be summarized as
instructional in nature.27
## A P E S T A N D M U LT I P LY I N G C H U R C H E S
When considering the importance of developing a team, it is essential
to note that there isn’t a single solution for every context. However,
developing a multiplying church that is effectively engaging its context
will no doubt involve team dynamics that are informed by the fivefold
typology of Ephesians 4.
Practically speaking, how do you incorporate ****APEST**** into the devel­
opment of a team?
1.	Understand your gifts considering ****APEST**** because it will
influence where you focus your ministry. Example: A teacher
will focus on a Sunday gathering to teach.
2.	Understand the makeup of your team and recognize what
gifts may be missing. If you are a gifted shepherd, you need
someone apostolic or you will never start something new. But
likewise, if you are apostolic, you must have a shepherd or you
will likely push people too hard and run the risk of burnout.
3.	Determine how each gift will have equal input into the mission
and ministry of the church. Remember that a key aspect of
Ephesians 4 is that the church will not reach maturity unless
all five gifts are activated and exercised.
4.	Determine how to ensure the equipping of the saints. How will
you encourage and empower those with the gift of teaching to
equip other teachers? How will those who have an apostolic
calling fan the flame of other sent ones? How will the evan­
gelist equip others who have an evangelistic calling?
5.	Measure success. How will you measure success from an
****APEST**** perspective? How can APEST become a mark of the
church?
If these are functions of the community, here is one way to frame
measuring language to determine how the church is doing in each
area:
•	 A: **missional** impact
•	 P: covenant faithfulness
•	 E: gospel proclamation
•	 S: reconciled community
•	 T: deep wisdom
Remember, a church that can bring together, encourage, and capture
the gifting of a fully functioning team will succeed in whatever it is
seeking to achieve. ****APEST**** adds a necessary ingredient to the overall
**missional** fitness and maturity of the church but must be informed
and shaped by the others to anchor the church in the fullness of
Christ’s nature and mission.
# P O S S I B L E O B J E C T I O N S
Amid conversations surrounding ****APEST****, there are occasionally ques­
tions regarding the significance of Ephesians 4. Some will ask, “Are
we putting too much emphasis on ****APEST****, especially when it seems
to be based on one passage of Scripture?” A second question often
includes the other gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians and Romans 12.
People ask why the gifts in Ephesians 4 are given prominence over
gifts mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament.
The following responses should help address concerns you may have
when considering ****APEST****.
1.	Biblical commentators have long-held Ephesians as a consti­
tutional document of the church. Like all constitutions, it is
meant to guide subsequent thinking and action in the orga­
nization. The book represents the best way to think about the
church—at least how Paul understood it.
2.	Ephesians 4:1-16 presents a promise that no other passage of
Scripture claims: maturity and fullness of Christ (vv. 11-16).
If we desire unity (vv. 1-6) and strive for maturity (vv. 11-16),
then it is difficult to discount the connection point between
unity and maturity with the diversity of gifts given by Christ
in verses 7-11.
3.	Ephesians 4 is not the only passage in which ****APEST**** is
mentioned.
•	 Apostle is used over 80 times in the New Testament.
•	 Prophet is used nearly 800 times in Scripture, over 150
times in the New Testament.
•	 Evangelist is used in Acts and 2 Timothy.
•	 Shepherd is used 23 times in the New Testament.
•	 Teacher is used 129 times in the New Testament.
•	 The word pastor, which we have no problem using as
the catch-all for leadership, is used once, and it is in
Ephesians 4.
4.	If you struggle to think about these gifts as personal callings
or vocations (they are certainly not roles or offices), then at
least consider them as communal functions of the church.
Should the church be apostolic? Prophetic? Evangelistic? Is
the church to be a shepherding and teaching community? The
answer to each of these questions is a resounding yes! These
five functions should define what the church does.
5.	The key word in 1 Corinthians is “manifestations” or gifts of
the Spirit. The gifts are tools given to execute the calling. The
key word in Romans 12 is “praxis,” which is skill-based, while
Ephesians 4 are callings given to the body by Jesus. The callings
in Ephesians 4 are the people. Think of them as how we are
wired instead of spiritual gifts given to a person. Compare the
distinction between the passages to being a carpenter. If my
calling is to be a carpenter, I am wired and gifted at carpentry
work. However, as a carpenter I have several tools that I will
use including a level, saw, hammer, and router.
Or consider the spiritual gift of hospitality. Someone wired as
a shepherd may provide hospitality as they desire to welcome
people into their home. But someone wired apostolically may
be hospitable because they want to start something new and
welcome others into that new adventure. The gift is the same,
but the motivation is different.
6.	Recognize the gifts are given to the church at Jesus’ ascension.
Why, in His ascension, does Jesus bestow the fivefold approach
on the church?
•	 We become equipped, perfected, or completed
(Ephesians 4:12).
•	 We can live out the unity described in Ephesians 4:1-6
(Ephesians 4:13).
•	 We grow into maturity, so we attain the fullness of Christ
•	 We are not given to theological fads or deception and
will stand firm (Ephesians 4:14).
•	 We grow up into Christ, our head (Ephesians 4:15).
•	 We will be rightly ordered in our relationship to our
head and to each other as His body (Ephesians 4:15-16).
7.	Consider ****APEST**** to be broader than Ephesians 4. Some would
argue that we can actually see ****APEST**** in the created order,
not just the church. In other words, ****APEST**** is laced by God
throughout His creation. Are there teachers in society? Shep­
herds? Evangelists?
Further, and this is incredibly significant, ****APEST**** is incorporated
fully into the life of Jesus. He is the perfect archetype of each
gift. He is the ultimate Apostle, the perfect Prophet, the good
news Evangelist, the Good Shepherd, and the great Teacher.</div></div></div><div class="mt-20 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200/50 dark:border-gray-800/50"><div class="flex justify-between

there are functional distinctions\nbetween various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical\ndivision between clergy and laity.” —Howard Snyder\nThere is an adage that speaks to the importance of change in an\norganization. The saying goes, “We are perfectly designed to achieve\nwhat we are currently achieving.” If we apply this statement to the\nchurch, a question we might ask is: are we satisfied with what we\nare currently achieving? In other words, are we totally content with\nthe impact the church is having? If we are totally honest, the answer\nwould likely be a resounding no.\nIf we are perfectly designed to achieve what the church is currently\nachieving, then shouldn’t we ask if there is an issue in the way we\nare designed? Or at least question if there is an issue in the way we\nunderstand the nature of the church and its place in God’s mission?\nAre there “design” factors that we need to rethink to achieve the\noutcomes we desire?\nPart of the solution is found in rethinking the nature of the church,\nmission, culture, **multiplication**, and vocation. However, I believe\nthere is also an organizational issue to be addressed. The church\nmust activate every member of the body.\n# C L E R G Y- L A I T Y D I V I D E\nBefore we address how to look at the gifting and functions of the\nbody of Christ, let’s consider a general view of leadership that has\nkept the church from fully realizing its calling. I am referring to what\nis considered the clergy-laity divide.\nThe word laity comes from a Greek word laos, meaning “people of God.”\nToday we often use the related term “layperson” to distinguish from\n“professional.” A layperson is someone in a particular discipline who\nis seen as an “amateur” who dabbles in an area but doesn’t operate\nwith a high level of skill or expertise. The professional, on the other\nhand, is the expert. While there may be a place for this division in\nthe business world and sports, there is no biblical basis for such a\ndistinction in the church.\nAs Eugene Peterson writes\nWithin the Christian community there are few words that are\nmore disabling than “layperson” and “laity.” The words convey\nthe impression—an impression that quickly solidifies into a\nlie—that there is a two-level hierarchy among the men and\nwomen who follow Jesus. There are those who are trained,\nsometimes referred to as “the called,” the professionals who\nare paid to preach, teach, and provide guidance in the Christian\nway, occupying the upper level. The lower level is made up of\neveryone else, those whom God assigned jobs as storekeepers,\nlawyers, journalists, parents, and computer programmers.25\nMinistry is not set aside for some professional class within the church.\nAll the people of God are called and commissioned. In The Community\nof the *King*, Howard Snyder speaks to this issue:\nThe New Testament doctrine of ministry rests not on the clergy-\nlaity distinction but on the twin and complementary pillars of\nthe priesthood of all believers and the gifts of the Spirit. Today,\nfour centuries after the Reformation, the full implications of this\nProtestant affirmation have yet to be worked out. The clergy-laity\ndichotomy is a direct carry-over from pre-Reformation Roman\nCatholicism and a throwback to the Old Testament priesthood.\nIt is one of the principal obstacles to the church effectively\nbeing God’s agent of the Kingdom today because it creates a\nfalse idea that only “holy men,” namely, ordained ministers, are\nreally qualified and responsible for leadership and significant\nministry. In the New Testament there are functional distinctions\nbetween various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical division\nbetween clergy and laity.26\nWe must “de-professionalize” ministry and give it back to the people of\nGod. However, this does not mean we don’t have leaders. Any signif­\nicant **multiplication** movement that makes an impact has definitive\nleadership, but we cannot confuse leadership with a call to participate\nin Jesus’ redemptive mission.\nWhen we look at the early church, we see that everyone is regarded as\na significant agent of the King and has a place in the unfolding of the\nmovement. In other words, in the church that Jesus built, everyone\ngets to play. In fact, everyone must play!\n# T H E I M P O R TA N C E O F A P E S T\nSo if we are to activate all of God’s people for mission, how do we\naccomplish this task? Part of the solution to diminishing the clergy-laity\ndivide and helping the laos engage in mission and ministry involves\nbroadening our concept of ministry. We need to move beyond ministry\nbeing framed simply by the traditional pastor-teacher model of the\nchurch to a fivefold understanding of ministry giftings as described\nin Ephesians 4:1-16.\nThis fivefold framework is often referred to as ****APEST****: apostle, prophet,\nevangelist, shepherd, and teacher. Most of the time, Ephesians 4 is\nviewed as a leadership text. In other words, we understand the gifts\nmentioned as leaders given to the church for the purpose of equipping\nthe people of God. However, Ephesians 4 is about the ministry of the\nchurch. It is a body of Christ text. Paul is stating that the gifts given to\nthe church are given to the laos—the whole people of God.\nAt the heart of this letter is Paul’s understanding and description of\nthe essential ministry of the church. Consider it this way:\n•\t In Ephesians 4:1-6, Paul calls us to realize our fundamental\nunity in the one God.\n•\t In Ephesians 4:7-11, he says that ****APEST**** has been given to the\nchurch by Christ.\n•\t In Ephesians 4:12-16, he says why ****APEST**** is given to build up,\nreach unity, and become mature.\nPaul outlines in simple terms the core ministries that make up the\nbody of Christ. He clearly states that Christ has given certain gifts to\neach one and distributed them throughout the body as He sees fit.\nThe ministry of the church is unmistakably stated as being at least\nfivefold in form through expression in the giftings of apostle, prophet,\nevangelist, shepherd, and teacher. And it is through the diversity of\n****APEST**** that the church can operate in the fullness of Christ.\nThe word equip in verse 12 is an interesting word choice. It was often\nused to describe the setting of a broken bone or alignment. Paul is\nsaying that each of the ministries within ****APEST**** add to the ability\nof the entire body to function properly. Our ability to grow, mature,\nand become the church that Jesus intended is directly linked to the\nministries within ****APEST****.\nSadly, most churches operate with only two out of the five: shepherding\nand teaching. In most cases, the ministries of the apostle, prophet, and\nevangelist have been minimized, if not completely relegated to the\nmargins. When we do this, we essentially cut off three-fifths of our\ncapacity to grow and mature as the body of Christ. This has damaged\nthe church’s ability to be the fullness of Jesus in the world.\n# A P E S T S U M M A R Y\nHere are summaries of each ****APEST**** ministry.\n# APOSTLE: SENT AND EXTENDS\nThe word apostle literally means “sent one.” The Latin form is missio,\nwhich is where we get the English word mission. The apostle is most\nresponsible to activate, develop, and protect the missionary sentness\nof the church. This sent quality gives the apostle’s life a catalytic\ninfluence, often playing the role of an entrepreneur at the forefront\nof new ventures. They are the cultural architects who are concerned\nwith the overall extension of Christianity throughout society. Because\nof this, they are often drawn to issues related to design, systems, and\noverarching organizational structures. They have a **missional** focus\nto their ministry.\n# PROPHET: QUESTIONS AND REFORMS\nProphets are sensitive to God and what is important to Him. They\noften sense what truth needs to be emphasized for their time and\nplace. Prophets are guardians of the covenant relationship. Whether\nit is in the church, society, or an organizational setting, prophets are\nquick to recognize the gap between “what is” and “what should be.”\nThe weight of this tension leads prophets to question the status quo\nas well as initiate efforts for reform. Ultimately, they are not satisfied\nuntil they see a “closing of the gap” between God’s demands and our\ncovenantal faithfulness. This desire to see the truth of God’s reality\nfleshed out in concrete and tangible ways gives an **incarnational**\nquality to their ministry.\n# EVANGELIST: RECRUITS AND GATHERS\nEvangelists communicate the message of the gospel in joyous, infec­\ntious ways. They enjoy meeting new people and wooing them into\na friendship. They are avid communicators of ideas and often share\ntheir thoughts and feelings in convincing ways. They are recruiters to\nthe cause and find fulfillment in helping people get caught up into the\ndriving narrative of the church—the gospel of the kingdom. As bearers\nof good news, they have an attractional quality to their ministry.\n# SHEPHERD: PROTECTS AND PROVIDES\nShepherds protect the community from danger and provide for its\nneeds on both an individual and communal level. They notice when\npeople are alone or hurting and feel drawn to nurture the spiritual\nand communal health of the church. They are loyal to the organization\nand the people within it. They ensure the community is experienced\nas a safe and loving environment, giving their ministry a distinctly\ncommunal focus.\n# TEACHER: UNDERSTANDS AND EXPLAINS\nTeachers find great satisfaction in helping people learn truth and\nwisdom. They grasp complex, systemic truths then help people\nunderstand them. They often formulate curriculum and pathways\nof learning. They ensure the truths of Scripture are passed from\ngeneration to generation. Their ministry could be summarized as\ninstructional in nature.27\n## A P E S T A N D M U LT I P LY I N G C H U R C H E S\nWhen considering the importance of developing a team, it is essential\nto note that there isn’t a single solution for every context. However,\ndeveloping a multiplying church that is effectively engaging its context\nwill no doubt involve team dynamics that are informed by the fivefold\ntypology of Ephesians 4.\nPractically speaking, how do you incorporate ****APEST**** into the devel­\nopment of a team?\n1.\tUnderstand your gifts considering ****APEST**** because it will\ninfluence where you focus your ministry. Example: A teacher\nwill focus on a Sunday gathering to teach.\n2.\tUnderstand the makeup of your team and recognize what\ngifts may be missing. If you are a gifted shepherd, you need\nsomeone apostolic or you will never start something new. But\nlikewise, if you are apostolic, you must have a shepherd or you\nwill likely push people too hard and run the risk of burnout.\n3.\tDetermine how each gift will have equal input into the mission\nand ministry of the church. Remember that a key aspect of\nEphesians 4 is that the church will not reach maturity unless\nall five gifts are activated and exercised.\n4.\tDetermine how to ensure the equipping of the saints. How will\nyou encourage and empower those with the gift of teaching to\nequip other teachers? How will those who have an apostolic\ncalling fan the flame of other sent ones? How will the evan­\ngelist equip others who have an evangelistic calling?\n5.\tMeasure success. How will you measure success from an\n****APEST**** perspective? How can APEST become a mark of the\nchurch?\nIf these are functions of the community, here is one way to frame\nmeasuring language to determine how the church is doing in each\narea:\n•\t A: **missional** impact\n•\t P: covenant faithfulness\n•\t E: gospel proclamation\n•\t S: reconciled community\n•\t T: deep wisdom\nRemember, a church that can bring together, encourage, and capture\nthe gifting of a fully functioning team will succeed in whatever it is\nseeking to achieve. ****APEST**** adds a necessary ingredient to the overall\n**missional** fitness and maturity of the church but must be informed\nand shaped by the others to anchor the church in the fullness of\nChrist’s nature and mission.\n# P O S S I B L E O B J E C T I O N S\nAmid conversations surrounding ****APEST****, there are occasionally ques­\ntions regarding the significance of Ephesians 4. Some will ask, “Are\nwe putting too much emphasis on ****APEST****, especially when it seems\nto be based on one passage of Scripture?” A second question often\nincludes the other gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians and Romans 12.\nPeople ask why the gifts in Ephesians 4 are given prominence over\ngifts mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament.\nThe following responses should help address concerns you may have\nwhen considering ****APEST****.\n1.\tBiblical commentators have long-held Ephesians as a consti­\ntutional document of the church. Like all constitutions, it is\nmeant to guide subsequent thinking and action in the orga­\nnization. The book represents the best way to think about the\nchurch—at least how Paul understood it.\n2.\tEphesians 4:1-16 presents a promise that no other passage of\nScripture claims: maturity and fullness of Christ (vv. 11-16).\nIf we desire unity (vv. 1-6) and strive for maturity (vv. 11-16),\nthen it is difficult to discount the connection point between\nunity and maturity with the diversity of gifts given by Christ\nin verses 7-11.\n3.\tEphesians 4 is not the only passage in which ****APEST**** is\nmentioned.\n•\t Apostle is used over 80 times in the New Testament.\n•\t Prophet is used nearly 800 times in Scripture, over 150\ntimes in the New Testament.\n•\t Evangelist is used in Acts and 2 Timothy.\n•\t Shepherd is used 23 times in the New Testament.\n•\t Teacher is used 129 times in the New Testament.\n•\t The word pastor, which we have no problem using as\nthe catch-all for leadership, is used once, and it is in\nEphesians 4.\n4.\tIf you struggle to think about these gifts as personal callings\nor vocations (they are certainly not roles or offices), then at\nleast consider them as communal functions of the church.\nShould the church be apostolic? Prophetic? Evangelistic? Is\nthe church to be a shepherding and teaching community? The\nanswer to each of these questions is a resounding yes! These\nfive functions should define what the church does.\n5.\tThe key word in 1 Corinthians is “manifestations” or gifts of\nthe Spirit. The gifts are tools given to execute the calling. The\nkey word in Romans 12 is “praxis,” which is skill-based, while\nEphesians 4 are callings given to the body by Jesus. The callings\nin Ephesians 4 are the people. Think of them as how we are\nwired instead of spiritual gifts given to a person. Compare the\ndistinction between the passages to being a carpenter. If my\ncalling is to be a carpenter, I am wired and gifted at carpentry\nwork. However, as a carpenter I have several tools that I will\nuse including a level, saw, hammer, and router.\nOr consider the spiritual gift of hospitality. Someone wired as\na shepherd may provide hospitality as they desire to welcome\npeople into their home. But someone wired apostolically may\nbe hospitable because they want to start something new and\nwelcome others into that new adventure. The gift is the same,\nbut the motivation is different.\n6.\tRecognize the gifts are given to the church at Jesus’ ascension.\nWhy, in His ascension, does Jesus bestow the fivefold approach\non the church?\n•\t We become equipped, perfected, or completed\n(Ephesians 4:12).\n•\t We can live out the unity described in Ephesians 4:1-6\n(Ephesians 4:13).\n•\t We grow into maturity, so we attain the fullness of Christ\n•\t We are not given to theological fads or deception and\nwill stand firm (Ephesians 4:14).\n•\t We grow up into Christ, our head (Ephesians 4:15).\n•\t We will be rightly ordered in our relationship to our\nhead and to each other as His body (Ephesians 4:15-16).\n7.\tConsider ****APEST**** to be broader than Ephesians 4. Some would\nargue that we can actually see ****APEST**** in the created order,\nnot just the church. In other words, ****APEST**** is laced by God\nthroughout His creation. Are there teachers in society? Shep­\nherds? Evangelists?\nFurther, and this is incredibly significant, ****APEST**** is incorporated\nfully into the life of Jesus. He is the perfect archetype of each\ngift. He is the ultimate Apostle, the perfect Prophet, the good\nnews Evangelist, the Good Shepherd, and the great Teacher."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"18:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mx-auto max-w-4xl\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mdx-content prose prose-lg md:prose-xl prose-slate dark:prose-invert mx-auto prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-h1:text-4xl prose-h1:mb-8 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h2:mt-12 prose-h2:mb-6 prose-h3:text-xl prose-h3:mt-8 prose-h3:mb-4 prose-p:text-lg prose-p:leading-8 prose-p:mb-6 prose-strong:text-blue-600 dark:prose-strong:text-blue-400 prose-em:text-gray-600 dark:prose-em:text-gray-400 prose-li:text-lg prose-li:leading-8 prose-li:mb-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-blue-500 prose-blockquote:bg-blue-50/50 dark:prose-blockquote:bg-blue-950/20 prose-blockquote:px-6 prose-blockquote:py-4 prose-blockquote:rounded-r-lg max-w-none\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"space-y-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed [\u0026\u003e*:first-child]:mt-0\",\"children\":\"$1a\"}]}]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mt-20 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200/50 dark:border-gray-800/50\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex justify-between items-center\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"children\":[\"Chapter \",11,\" of the ReThink Book\"]}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"mt-1\",\"children\":[\"By \",\"$undefined\"]}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex space-x-4\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"button\",null,{\"className\":\"inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 elegant-transition border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 bg-background hover:bg-surface hover:text-text-primary h-9 rounded-md px-3 glass-card\",\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"svg\",null,{\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"xmlns\":\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",\"width\":24,\"height\":24,\"viewBox\":\"0 0 24 24\",\"fill\":\"none\",\"stroke\":\"currentColor\",\"strokeWidth\":2,\"strokeLinecap\":\"round\",\"strokeLinejoin\":\"round\",\"className\":\"lucide lucide-arrow-left w-4 h-4 mr-2\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"path\",\"1l729n\",{\"d\":\"m12 19-7-7 7-7\"}],[\"$\",\"path\",\"x3x0zl\",{\"d\":\"M19 12H5\"}],\"$undefined\"]}],\"Previous\"]}],[\"$\",\"button\",null,{\"className\":\"inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 elegant-transition border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 bg-background hover:bg-surface hover:text-text-primary h-9 rounded-md px-3 glass-card\",\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"children\":[\"Next\",[\"$\",\"svg\",null,{\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"xmlns\":\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",\"width\":24,\"height\":24,\"viewBox\":\"0 0 24 24\",\"fill\":\"none\",\"stroke\":\"currentColor\",\"strokeWidth\":2,\"strokeLinecap\":\"round\",\"strokeLinejoin\":\"round\",\"className\":\"lucide lucide-arrow-right w-4 h-4 ml-2\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"path\",\"1ays0h\",{\"d\":\"M5 12h14\"}],[\"$\",\"path\",\"xquz4c\",{\"d\":\"m12 5 7 7-7 7\"}],\"$undefined\"]}]]}]]}]]}]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"d:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\n9:null\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"b:{\"metadata\":[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"Fluid Dark Elegance - Premium Business Solutions\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"Sophisticated business solutions designed for executive excellence.
