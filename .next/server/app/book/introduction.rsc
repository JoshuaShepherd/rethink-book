# INTRODUCTION
“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who
cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn,
unlearn, and relearn.” —Alvin Toffler
When bringing about change in the way people behave, we often
need to start with questions of “why” before considering the practical
issues of “how.” In the book Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire
Everyone to *Take Action*, Simon Sinek contends that there are two
primary ways to influence human behavior: you can either manip­
ulate it or inspire it. While manipulation is not always negative, for
example when a retailer drops the price of a product to motivate a
purchase, it often involves the use of fear or peer pressure to influ­
ence behavior. Additionally, change that is manipulated is usually
short-lived.
Inspiring change, on the other hand, involves the consideration of
deeper issues. We need to ask underlying questions of “why.” Why
do we perceive things in a particular way? Why do we behave in a
certain manner? What are the motivations or inherent factors that
undergird our behaviors?
Ronald Heifetz deals with similar issues of change in Leadership
Without Easy Answers, making a distinction between organizational
change and cultural change. He argues that organizational change
typically involves restructuring, along with the use of new programs,
processes, and techniques. Cultural change, however, looks at how
to create a new culture or environment, which will require a new
set of skills and capacities. By connecting the themes of these two
books, we can say that cultural change is about starting with the
“why,” while organizational change is more about the practical issues
of “how.”
This topic of change is important in church **multiplication** because
responses to the crises of the church in North America will not be
organizational changes. We can’t settle with minor adjustments in
our **ecclesiology**, how we do church. The problem is deeply rooted.
We must rethink to make cultural changes and ask the “why” ques­
tions. The underlying issues are primarily spiritual, theological,
and **missiological**. If we want to plant disciple-making, **missional**
churches that have a mindset of **multiplication**, it will take deep
cultural change in the way we think about God’s mission and the
nature of the church, as well as how the church lives out that mis­
sion in local contexts. We must change our attitude from “we have
never done it that way before” to “whatever it takes.”
Another way to frame the rethinking discussion is by using the
language of paradigm. The word paradigm commonly refers to a
perception, assumption, or frame of reference. In a general sense,
it’s how we see the world in terms of perception, understanding,
and interpreting.
Every organization, including the church, is built upon underlying
paradigms or assumptions. This is not the same thing as the church’s
beliefs or theological systems. Rather, the paradigm determines how
an organization thinks and acts. Paradigms explain behavior then
guide behavior. If we try to restructure an organization but leave the
original paradigms in place, then little will change. For real change
to take place, we need a paradigm shift or, in most cases, multiple
paradigm shifts.
A paradigm shift occurs when there is a fundamental change in
an underlying assumption. It’s a change from one way of thinking
to another, a rethinking. There is a transformation, a sort of meta­
morphosis that takes place. For the church to move from a mindset
of addition (simply planting growing churches) to one of multipli­
cation (planting reproducing churches), the church must rethink
several key shifts in the way we think and the way we behave.
While it isn’t complicated, it is certainly multifaceted.
When I first wrote Rethink, I shared 9 paradigm shifts to activate
the church. Since that time and based on the feedback I have
received from church leaders, that initial list has grown. In this
revised and expanded version, I now unpack 12 **missiological** prin­
ciples we must rethink to activate the people of God to engage in
His redemptive mission. Separately, none of these principles are
a cure-all for what ails the church in North America. However, as
we begin to think and act differently, I believe there is a synergistic
effect within these missionary arenas that will lead to multiplica­
tion of disciples and churches.
The strategies and models that fit earlier eras of church history are
simply no longer effective. What we need now is a new set of tools.
We need a fresh perspective—a new paradigm—and must rethink
church **multiplication**, especially as it relates to our understanding
of the church, mission, and church planting.18:["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-4xl","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mdx-content prose prose-lg md:prose-xl prose-slate dark:prose-invert mx-auto prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-h1:text-4xl prose-h1:mb-8 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h2:mt-12 prose-h2:mb-6 prose-h3:text-xl prose-h3:mt-8 prose-h3:mb-4 prose-p:text-lg prose-p:leading-8 prose-p:mb-6 prose-strong:text-blue-600 dark:prose-strong:text-blue-400 prose-em:text-gray-600 dark:prose-em:text-gray-400 prose-li:text-lg prose-li:leading-8 prose-li:mb-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-blue-500 prose-blockquote:bg-blue-50/50 dark:prose-blockquote:bg-blue-950/20 prose-blockquote:px-6 prose-blockquote:py-4 prose-blockquote:rounded-r-lg max-w-none","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed [&>*:first-child]:mt-0","children":"$1a"}]}]}]
