# PRINCIPLE 8: RETHINK multiplication

“Movement occurs when the making of mis­
sion-shaped disciples—who live in the world for the
sake of the world, in the way of Christ—goes viral.”
> —J. R. Woodward and Dan White, Jr.
In 1,000 Churches by Ed Stetzer and Daniel Im, they discuss rapid repro­
duction of churches and compare the gestation periods of elephants
and rabbits. Elephants carry one calf for a gestation period of nearly
two years then nurse it for three years after birth before reproducing
again. On the other hand, rabbits carry a litter of typically 14 babies
for just one month. Then, in a matter of minutes after giving birth, that
rabbit can become pregnant again, repeating the cycle. There may be
a time and a place when an elephant-type approach is appropriate in
the church. But if our goal is rapid church **multiplication**, then we must
strive toward a movement that, as the saying goes, “breeds like rabbits.”21
# M U LT I P L I C AT I O N I S A M I N D S E T
Perhaps the first thing that should be said regarding church planting
and movements is that it has to be a mindset. We must have a “rabbit”
kind of mentality that will not only change the way we think about
church, mission, and **multiplication**, but it will begin to shape the
very way we function as the church.
Albert Einstein’s famous quote rings true here, “We can’t solve prob­
lems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created
them.” If we apply that to the church, then, “We cannot solve the
problems of the church by using the same kind of thinking we used
when we created those problems in the first place.” We can’t keep
thinking and doing what we have already done and expect different
results. We must rethink how we understand and live out the life of
the church if we wish to see a **multiplication** movement.
Make it a discipline to think movement, not institution. If you identify
yourself as a movement, then you will eventually start acting like one.
# T H E M A K E U P O F A
# M U LT I P L I C AT I O N M O V E M E N T
What are the tangible characteristics of multiplying churches? Here
are four aspects that contribute to a movement culture.
# 1. GOD’S MISSION IS CENTRAL.
A church that is focused on real movement has a strong emphasis
on the **missio Dei**. It is God who has a mission to set things right in a
broken world, to redeem and restore it to what He always intended.
A movement church understands that mission is not the invention,
responsibility, or program of the church. Instead, they see that mission
flows directly from the character and purposes of a missionary God.
A multiplying church not only understands that the mission is God’s
but also recognizes that His mission is larger than their individual
church. They live out the reality that God’s primary activity is in the
world and that their responsibility is to be sent into the world to
participate in what He is already doing. As a result, the church does not
simply send missionaries. They view their church as the missionary.
# 2. ALL OF GOD’S PEOPLE ARE
# ACTIVATED.
**multiplication** movements only succeed when they equip all of God’s
people. Every believer has potential to change the world. This transfor­
mation occurs more often through the ordinary than the extraordinary.
Our job as church leaders is to bring it out. As Tim Keller describes
this movement, “In every seed is the potential for a tree, and in every
tree the potential for a forest, but all of this is contained in the initial
seed.”22 In a movement church, everyone gets to play. No one sits on
the bench.
# 3. ADAPTIVE LEADERSHIP AND
# ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES
A movement church has leadership that knows how to move a church
and keep it moving. This type of leadership highlights apostolic and
prophetic roles. The apostolic person leads with a positive vision of what
can be, while the prophetic tends to call the status quo into question.
**multiplication** needs adaptive leadership, people who can help the
church transition to a different, nimbler version of itself. Such leaders
don’t necessarily have to be highly creative innovators, but they must
be people who can move the church into adaptive modes capable of
tackling adaptive challenges. These people create the conditions for
change and innovation.
In movement-focused churches, the effectiveness of the leaders is
not measured by what they accomplish but by how the people of
God are equipped, organized, and inspired to participate in God’s
mission in the world. This leadership and structure is geared toward
disciple-making. In the makeup of a movement, **discipleship** is the
engine for everything. Without it, the church will drift away from
its core calling.
As J. R. Woodward and Dan White write:
Movement occurs when the making of mission-shaped disci­
ples—who live in the world for the sake of the world, in the way
of Christ—goes viral. Movement is about developing structures
and systems that catapult people into mission, where repro­
ducing **discipleship** groups, **missional** communities, churches
and networks of churches is a natural part of its DNA. It’s the
ripple effect: throwing a rock into a pond creates one ripple and
then another and another, till ripples cover the whole pond.23
## 4. ****APEST****, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE A
We will examine ****APEST**** in principle 9, but for a quick summary,
it denotes the roles of apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and
teacher in Ephesians 4. Keller notes that all ****APEST**** ministries are vital,
but the apostolic role leads to movement. As Keller writes, “This is
not an emphasis of importance or priority; it is one of purpose and
design.”24 Apostolic people push against current boundaries and
propel Christianity into new areas. If you remove apostolic leaders,
you won’t see **multiplication** movement.18:["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-4xl","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mdx-content prose prose-lg md:prose-xl prose-slate dark:prose-invert mx-auto prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-h1:text-4xl prose-h1:mb-8 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h2:mt-12 prose-h2:mb-6 prose-h3:text-xl prose-h3:mt-8 prose-h3:mb-4 prose-p:text-lg prose-p:leading-8 prose-p:mb-6 prose-strong:text-blue-600 dark:prose-strong:text-blue-400 prose-em:text-gray-600 dark:prose-em:text-gray-400 prose-li:text-lg prose-li:leading-8 prose-li:mb-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-blue-500 prose-blockquote:bg-blue-50/50 dark:prose-blockquote:bg-blue-950/20 prose-blockquote:px-6 prose-blockquote:py-4 prose-blockquote:rounded-r-lg max-w-none","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed [&>*:first-child]:mt-0","children":"$1a"}]}]}]
