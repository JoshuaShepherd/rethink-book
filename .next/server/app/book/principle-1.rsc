# PRINCIPLE 1: RETHINK THE MISSIONARY NATURE OF GOD

> "Mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an attribute of God." —David Bosch
The most foundational **missiological** shift that must take place for
# PRINCIPLE 1: RETHINK THE MISSIONARY NATURE OF GOD'

“Mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an
attribute of God.” —David Bosch
many Christians relates to their understanding of the missionary
nature of God and the church. Let’s first consider the missionary
nature of God then discuss implications on the way we understand
the church.
When we think about the attributes of God, we most often think of
characteristics such as holiness, sovereignty, wisdom, justice, love, and
so forth. Rarely do we think of God’s missionary nature. But Scripture
teaches that God is a missionary God, a sending God.
The missionary nature of God can be framed in two primary ways.
The first involves the grand narrative of Scripture. When we consider
the grand story or metanarrative of Scripture, we discover it is about
God’s redemptive purposes. All Scripture and doctrines of biblical faith
connect around God’s grand plan and purpose for creation. Mission
is the central theme describing God’s activity throughout history to
restore creation. The mission of God unifies the Bible from creation
to new creation.1
A second way to recognize God’s missionary nature is to examine the
“sending language” throughout the Bible. From God sending Abram
in Genesis 12 to the sending of His angel in Revelation 22, hundreds
of sending examples portray God as a missionary-sending God. The
Hebrew verb **shelach**, meaning “to send,” is found nearly 800 times in
the Old Testament. While it is often used in a variety of non-theological
sayings and phrases, it is employed more than 200 times with God as
the subject of the verb. In other words, God commissions and sends.
Exodus 3:10-15 contains a fascinating dialogue surrounding God’s
prompting of Moses to confront Pharaoh. God is sending Moses to
convince the king of Egypt to release the Israelites from bondage. In
the six verses, there are five references to sending.
“So now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the
Israelites out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that
I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to
you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the
people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.”
Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to
them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they
ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” God
said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to
the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ” God also said to Moses,
“Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has
sent me to you’ ” (emphasis added).
The prominence of sending language is not only seen in Genesis and
Exodus but throughout the historical, poetic, and prophetic books of
the Old Testament. God is a sending God. Especially when you consider
the prophets, it is easy to see that they were sent by God to participate
in His redemptive purposes. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration
of sending in the Old Testament is found in Isaiah 6. In this passage,
we catch a glimpse of God’s sending nature in its **trinitarian** fullness.
“Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And
who will go for us?’ And I said, ‘Here am I. Send me!’” (Isaiah 6:8,
emphasis added).
Later in Isaiah 61:1-3, it is interesting to note that there are no fewer
than seven acts of redemption that proceed from or depend on the
Hebrew verb “sent.” To emphasize how central the sending theme
is, the passage could be rendered this way:
> He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
> He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the captives,
> He has sent me to release from darkness for the prisoners,
> He has sent me to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and
> the day of vengeance of our God,
> He has sent me to comfort all who mourn,
> He has sent me to provide for those who grieve in Zion,
> He has sent me to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead
> of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of
> praise instead of a spirit of despair.
> Jesus applies this passage to His own ministry in Luke 4:18-19 as He
> claims to be the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1-3. These verses become, in
> a sense, the personal mission statement for Jesus.
> The Old Testament ends with God promising to send a special
> messenger as the forerunner of the Messiah: “I will send my messenger”
> (Malachi 3:1, emphasis added). The New Testament begins with the
> arrival of that messenger in the person of John the Baptist, described
> in the Gospels as “a man sent from God” (John 1:6).
> In the New Testament, sending language is found not only in the
> Gospels but throughout Acts and the Epistles. The most comprehensive
> collection of sending language, however, is found in the Gospel of
> John, where the word send or sent is used nearly 60 times. Most uses
> refer to God as the “one who sends” and Jesus as the “one who is sent.”
> We see God the Father sending the Son, God the Father and the Son
> sending the Spirit, and God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit sending
> the church. In the final sending passage in John, Jesus makes clear
> that He is not only sent by the Father but now He is the sender, as
> He sends the disciples: “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you”
> (John 20:21, emphasis added).
> With this sentence, Jesus draws more than a vague parallel between His
> mission and ours. Deliberately and precisely, He makes His mission the
> model for ours. Our understanding of the church’s mission must flow
> from our understanding of Jesus’ mission as revealed in the Gospels.18:["$","div",null,{"className":"mx-auto max-w-4xl","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"mdx-content prose prose-lg md:prose-xl prose-slate dark:prose-invert mx-auto prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-h1:text-4xl prose-h1:mb-8 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h2:mt-12 prose-h2:mb-6 prose-h3:text-xl prose-h3:mt-8 prose-h3:mb-4 prose-p:text-lg prose-p:leading-8 prose-p:mb-6 prose-strong:text-blue-600 dark:prose-strong:text-blue-400 prose-em:text-gray-600 dark:prose-em:text-gray-400 prose-li:text-lg prose-li:leading-8 prose-li:mb-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-blue-500 prose-blockquote:bg-blue-50/50 dark:prose-blockquote:bg-blue-950/20 prose-blockquote:px-6 prose-blockquote:py-4 prose-blockquote:rounded-r-lg max-w-none","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"space-y-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed [&>*:first-child]:mt-0","children":"$1a"}]}]}]
