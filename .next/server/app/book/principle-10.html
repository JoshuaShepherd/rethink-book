# PRINCIPLE 10: RETHINK STRATEGIES AND MODELS

“No strategy will reach every kind of person except
a strategy that mobilizes every kind of person.”
&gt; —Brian Sanders
Church **multiplication** and church planting take many different
forms; therefore, defining the models is a difficult task. However,
as we discuss how to rethink church **multiplication**, here are four
approaches in the church planting landscape.
•	 Contemporary attractional or launch
•	 **missional** communities or microchurches
•	 Campus or multisite
•	 Replant
# C O N T E M P O R A R Y AT T R A C T I O N A L
# O R L A U N C H
In a contemporary attractional or launch model, a church planter
begins with a launch team. In some cases, the church plant may
even begin with a small staff. This model seeks to build a core group,
usually 30–50 people, which will become their launch team. Often
there is a “sending church” that is large enough to send the people
that make up the initial team.
Once a launch team is formed, the church will conduct a series of
preview services to give the target community a picture of what
the church will be like before it goes public. In some cases, a church
plant may refer to this as a “soft launch,” where the core group holds
corporate gatherings that are less publicized to increase the size of the
launch team and build momentum. At the time of the “hard” launch,
the church will send out a mass-mailer or other marketing to invite
the community to attend the new church.
Because much of church planting over the past four decades has been
focused in suburban areas populated by middle to upper class families,
the launch model has been effective. However, it has lost some of its
effectiveness in areas saturated by other contemporary churches. And
as North America is increasingly becoming a missionary context, the
percentage of people open to this kind of church plant is declining.
# ADVANTAGES
Launching large breaks growth barriers. Begin small, and chances
are the church will remain small. But start large, and the church will
break growth barriers quicker. One effective way to shatter growth
barriers is with momentum created by launching large. Momentum is
one of a planter’s best tools for growth. Launching large can produce
tremendous momentum.
Launching large provides credibility. When a first-time guest walks into
a new church and sees a large crowd, they immediately sense that
something good is happening, and the credibility of the church increases.
Launching large facilitates financial sustainability. By launching with
a large group, the church may be able to quickly become financially
sustainable. Learning to effectively raise funds and creating a well
planned budget for a new church are foundational for launching
large and becoming self-sustaining within a couple of years.
# POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES
Launching large has a higher cost. On the flip side of becoming finan­
cially sustainable faster, it costs more to launch a large church. Further,
many expenses will be up front, including rent for a meeting space,
sound system and video equipment, computers, musical instruments,
and supplies for children’s ministry. Marketing for the launch is
another significant financial commitment.
Launching large can be stressful. Beginning with a church of 100 or
more people will create challenges with assimilation, programming,
and development. Because of the potential to start with a large
group, the planting team will need systems in place prior to the first
public service. Rather than simply going through a worship service,
plans will have to be made for children, parking, group space, and
so forth before the church opens its doors. This can be stressful and
time-consuming.
# M I S S I O N A L C O M M U N I T I E S
# O R M I C R O C H U R C H E S
Proponents of a **missional** community or microchurch model propose
that when starting a new church, you should begin with missionary
activity and not with the corporate gathering. Church planting over
the past several decades has really focused on a church service. When
the emphasis is on the large gathering, we can lose focus on what God
is doing in the surrounding context. Further, because many people
today are less interested in the programs and activities of the church,
starting a church by attempting to attract people to attend a corporate
gathering may prove to be difficult.
# WHAT IS A **missional** COMMUNITY?
**missional** communities are not smaller church services, Bible studies,
small groups, or other programs of the church. Instead, **missional**
communities are the church. Those who follow this model will gather
their **missional** communities into a corporate setting once there are
three or more communities. They may meet once a month then choose
to gather on a weekly basis.
Many have been so conditioned by what they have experienced through
typical church activities that they naturally seek to make **missional**
communities fit what they have known before. Other programs and
activities of the church are great for the purposes they serve, but they
do not generally deliver on the purposes of **missional** communities.
A **missional** community is a committed group of Jesus followers, the
size of an extended family (12–25 people), and empowered by the
Spirit to participate in God’s mission of redemption in a particular
neighborhood and/or network. Hopefully, this definition offers a
framework to differentiate a **missional** community from a traditional
small group. It is important as you define what a **missional** commu­
nity looks like in your context that you are not too prescriptive. In
other words, allow each **missional** community to be unique to their
context and mission. All **missional** communities will not, and should
not, look alike.
# MICROCHURCHES
While microchurches share several characteristics with **missional**
communities, there are a couple differences. Like **missional** communities,
microchurches see mission as the organizing principle of their existence.
However, microchurches not only focus on specific neighborhoods
and networks of relationships but engage in specific problems. These
areas of **missional** engagement could include poverty issues, human
trafficking, education, crime, homelessness, mental health, and other
areas of brokenness where gospel restoration is needed.
The language of microchurch provides a broader umbrella to encom­
pass a variety of church expressions. How and where microchurches
gather and engage their **missional** contexts will be different. Some
will meet in their homes, as that approach often makes sense for
reaching a neighborhood or a social network. Others will meet
in coffee shops, cafés, community centers, apartment complexes,
and the like.
Like **missional** communities, microchurches will not, and should
not, look alike. Perhaps the greatest distinction between a **missional**
community and a microchurch is that microchurches are seen as
the church in its smallest, most nimble, and potent expression. Most
**missional** communities are closely “tethered” to the larger church.
**missional** communities are seen by many as an outreach expression
of the church.
Microchurches, on the other hand, give special emphasis to empow­
ering people to use their gifts and resources to engage in God’s redemp­
tive mission. They provide an opportunity for localized leaders to
create and contextualize expressions of the church. They give both
the license to lead and creative control. This does not negate the
benefits of networking microchurches together for the sake of training,
coaching, accountability, and movement. However, those resources
exist to support the microchurches, not for the microchurches to
support the network.
# ADVANTAGES
•	 They are highly relational. Both **missional** communities and
microchurches network and build bridges throughout the
community, including neighborhoods, businesses, schools,
non-profits, local government, and so forth.
•	 They disciple their way into church planting. By loving and
serving people through a growing network of relationships,
a **missional** community or microchurch will create space for
people to belong before they believe. In this space **discipleship**
happens, which in turn leads to the **multiplication** of churches,
not the other way around.
•	 They are a better fit for certain contexts. A **missional** commu­
nity or microchurch approach is more conducive in urban
contexts, along with places where meeting space is limited
or expensive. The relational aspect is also more fruitful in
post-Christian environments.
•	 Slower growth. The nature of a relational, disciple-making
approach inherently leads to slower growth. A church planter
that employs this model needs to have a long “runway”
perspective.
•	 Financial stability. Because of the grassroots nature of this
approach, the church plant may not experience financial
sustainability for several years. However, because bivocational
or covocational leadership best fits this model, the church plant
may be in a position to focus on steady, long-term growth.
# C A M P U S O R M U LT I S I T E
Many churches find the campus or multisite model, compared to
building larger facilities, more fiscally wise and sustainable.
# ADVANTAGES
•	 They are well resourced. Multisite churches are usually well
resourced—fiscally, organizationally, structurally, and profes­
sionally—because they are connected to a main campus. This
connection strengthens the foundation of the new campus.
Multisite and satellite campuses can also be a great incubator
for developing emerging leaders.
•	 They are an effective way for an existing church to extend their
reach. Churches who implement a multisite model can extend
their mission and vision to a different geographical area. In
many cases, the campus is an area that already has people
who attend the main campus. The church can start with a
built-in launch team that understands the church’s vision,
mission, and strategy. Many multisite churches embrace the
motto, “One church in multiple locations.”
•	 They can be personality driven. One drawback is that multisite
campuses can be built around a single personality, especially
if the lead teaching pastor is the same for all campuses. When
the church is built upon one personality, the church can suffer
when that person is no longer there.
•	 They can lack contextualization. Another drawback is that
this model can create “cookie cutter” churches that are not
properly contextualized. When an existing church’s vision
and mission is “imported” in a different geographical context,
it may not be a good fit for that location. Just because a church
model and strategy are successful in one setting doesn’t guar­
antee it will be effective in another.
# R E P L A N T
The replant process involves the decision to close an existing church
and relaunch as a new church, with new leadership, a new name,
new governance, and a new ministry approach. In this model, a
dying church avoids permanent death by recognizing it will no longer
flourish unless conditions drastically change to facilitate growth.
# ADVANTAGES
•	 Builds on the history or legacy of the previous church. This may
help those who would prefer the status quo and recognizes
the church’s past impact in the community.
•	 A new identity creates momentum. Establishing a new identity
in the community can create momentum, enthusiasm, and
interest in the replant.
•	 Offers a break with the past and a fresh start for the future. Setting
an end date and a launch date avoids permanent death of
the church.
•	 Requires a new leader and a decision-making structure. To
replant, a new leader and new structure and approach for
making decisions must be in place.
•	 Those in power may reject the new leadership structure. A new
leadership structure is sometimes rejected by those in power.
•	 Patience is essential. The average turnaround time for a replant
is 5–7 years, so patience is key.
# F I N A L C O N S I D E R AT I O N S
Learn and implement the strengths of different models. There are
strengths and challenges of every model. While you may operate
from one model, it is helpful to incorporate the strengths from other
models. Perhaps in your context you should consider a hybrid that
takes the best of multiple models and implements them to suit your
needs for **multiplication**.
Pick a model that fits who you are and where you are. Do not import
a model from another leader or context. When considering church
**multiplication**, leaders are often guilty of attending a conference or
visiting another church and concluding that they want to plant the
church they have seen or heard about in their context. But resist the
temptation to import a model from outside your context. Pick a model
that fits your giftedness and your context.
Remember the model is just a tool, not the target. We live in a highly
pragmatic culture and want to know what works. We want to utilize
the products or approaches that produce the best results. But the
models are simply tools. Don’t put your faith in them to produce
results only God can produce. Instead, focus your faith on the calling

mobilizes every kind of person.”\n\u003e —Brian Sanders\nChurch **multiplication** and church planting take many different\nforms; therefore, defining the models is a difficult task. However,\nas we discuss how to rethink church **multiplication**, here are four\napproaches in the church planting landscape.\n•\t Contemporary attractional or launch\n•\t **missional** communities or microchurches\n•\t Campus or multisite\n•\t Replant\n# C O N T E M P O R A R Y AT T R A C T I O N A L\n# O R L A U N C H\nIn a contemporary attractional or launch model, a church planter\nbegins with a launch team. In some cases, the church plant may\neven begin with a small staff. This model seeks to build a core group,\nusually 30–50 people, which will become their launch team. Often\nthere is a “sending church” that is large enough to send the people\nthat make up the initial team.\nOnce a launch team is formed, the church will conduct a series of\npreview services to give the target community a picture of what\nthe church will be like before it goes public. In some cases, a church\nplant may refer to this as a “soft launch,” where the core group holds\ncorporate gatherings that are less publicized to increase the size of the\nlaunch team and build momentum. At the time of the “hard” launch,\nthe church will send out a mass-mailer or other marketing to invite\nthe community to attend the new church.\nBecause much of church planting over the past four decades has been\nfocused in suburban areas populated by middle to upper class families,\nthe launch model has been effective. However, it has lost some of its\neffectiveness in areas saturated by other contemporary churches. And\nas North America is increasingly becoming a missionary context, the\npercentage of people open to this kind of church plant is declining.\n# ADVANTAGES\nLaunching large breaks growth barriers. Begin small, and chances\nare the church will remain small. But start large, and the church will\nbreak growth barriers quicker. One effective way to shatter growth\nbarriers is with momentum created by launching large. Momentum is\none of a planter’s best tools for growth. Launching large can produce\ntremendous momentum.\nLaunching large provides credibility. When a first-time guest walks into\na new church and sees a large crowd, they immediately sense that\nsomething good is happening, and the credibility of the church increases.\nLaunching large facilitates financial sustainability. By launching with\na large group, the church may be able to quickly become financially\nsustainable. Learning to effectively raise funds and creating a well\nplanned budget for a new church are foundational for launching\nlarge and becoming self-sustaining within a couple of years.\n# POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES\nLaunching large has a higher cost. On the flip side of becoming finan­\ncially sustainable faster, it costs more to launch a large church. Further,\nmany expenses will be up front, including rent for a meeting space,\nsound system and video equipment, computers, musical instruments,\nand supplies for children’s ministry. Marketing for the launch is\nanother significant financial commitment.\nLaunching large can be stressful. Beginning with a church of 100 or\nmore people will create challenges with assimilation, programming,\nand development. Because of the potential to start with a large\ngroup, the planting team will need systems in place prior to the first\npublic service. Rather than simply going through a worship service,\nplans will have to be made for children, parking, group space, and\nso forth before the church opens its doors. This can be stressful and\ntime-consuming.\n# M I S S I O N A L C O M M U N I T I E S\n# O R M I C R O C H U R C H E S\nProponents of a **missional** community or microchurch model propose\nthat when starting a new church, you should begin with missionary\nactivity and not with the corporate gathering. Church planting over\nthe past several decades has really focused on a church service. When\nthe emphasis is on the large gathering, we can lose focus on what God\nis doing in the surrounding context. Further, because many people\ntoday are less interested in the programs and activities of the church,\nstarting a church by attempting to attract people to attend a corporate\ngathering may prove to be difficult.\n# WHAT IS A **missional** COMMUNITY?\n**missional** communities are not smaller church services, Bible studies,\nsmall groups, or other programs of the church. Instead, **missional**\ncommunities are the church. Those who follow this model will gather\ntheir **missional** communities into a corporate setting once there are\nthree or more communities. They may meet once a month then choose\nto gather on a weekly basis.\nMany have been so conditioned by what they have experienced through\ntypical church activities that they naturally seek to make **missional**\ncommunities fit what they have known before. Other programs and\nactivities of the church are great for the purposes they serve, but they\ndo not generally deliver on the purposes of **missional** communities.\nA **missional** community is a committed group of Jesus followers, the\nsize of an extended family (12–25 people), and empowered by the\nSpirit to participate in God’s mission of redemption in a particular\nneighborhood and/or network. Hopefully, this definition offers a\nframework to differentiate a **missional** community from a traditional\nsmall group. It is important as you define what a **missional** commu­\nnity looks like in your context that you are not too prescriptive. In\nother words, allow each **missional** community to be unique to their\ncontext and mission. All **missional** communities will not, and should\nnot, look alike.\n# MICROCHURCHES\nWhile microchurches share several characteristics with **missional**\ncommunities, there are a couple differences. Like **missional** communities,\nmicrochurches see mission as the organizing principle of their existence.\nHowever, microchurches not only focus on specific neighborhoods\nand networks of relationships but engage in specific problems. These\nareas of **missional** engagement could include poverty issues, human\ntrafficking, education, crime, homelessness, mental health, and other\nareas of brokenness where gospel restoration is needed.\nThe language of microchurch provides a broader umbrella to encom­\npass a variety of church expressions. How and where microchurches\ngather and engage their **missional** contexts will be different. Some\nwill meet in their homes, as that approach often makes sense for\nreaching a neighborhood or a social network. Others will meet\nin coffee shops, cafés, community centers, apartment complexes,\nand the like.\nLike **missional** communities, microchurches will not, and should\nnot, look alike. Perhaps the greatest distinction between a **missional**\ncommunity and a microchurch is that microchurches are seen as\nthe church in its smallest, most nimble, and potent expression. Most\n**missional** communities are closely “tethered” to the larger church.\n**missional** communities are seen by many as an outreach expression\nof the church.\nMicrochurches, on the other hand, give special emphasis to empow­\nering people to use their gifts and resources to engage in God’s redemp­\ntive mission. They provide an opportunity for localized leaders to\ncreate and contextualize expressions of the church. They give both\nthe license to lead and creative control. This does not negate the\nbenefits of networking microchurches together for the sake of training,\ncoaching, accountability, and movement. However, those resources\nexist to support the microchurches, not for the microchurches to\nsupport the network.\n# ADVANTAGES\n•\t They are highly relational. Both **missional** communities and\nmicrochurches network and build bridges throughout the\ncommunity, including neighborhoods, businesses, schools,\nnon-profits, local government, and so forth.\n•\t They disciple their way into church planting. By loving and\nserving people through a growing network of relationships,\na **missional** community or microchurch will create space for\npeople to belong before they believe. In this space **discipleship**\nhappens, which in turn leads to the **multiplication** of churches,\nnot the other way around.\n•\t They are a better fit for certain contexts. A **missional** commu­\nnity or microchurch approach is more conducive in urban\ncontexts, along with places where meeting space is limited\nor expensive. The relational aspect is also more fruitful in\npost-Christian environments.\n•\t Slower growth. The nature of a relational, disciple-making\napproach inherently leads to slower growth. A church planter\nthat employs this model needs to have a long “runway”\nperspective.\n•\t Financial stability. Because of the grassroots nature of this\napproach, the church plant may not experience financial\nsustainability for several years. However, because bivocational\nor covocational leadership best fits this model, the church plant\nmay be in a position to focus on steady, long-term growth.\n# C A M P U S O R M U LT I S I T E\nMany churches find the campus or multisite model, compared to\nbuilding larger facilities, more fiscally wise and sustainable.\n# ADVANTAGES\n•\t They are well resourced. Multisite churches are usually well\nresourced—fiscally, organizationally, structurally, and profes­\nsionally—because they are connected to a main campus. This\nconnection strengthens the foundation of the new campus.\nMultisite and satellite campuses can also be a great incubator\nfor developing emerging leaders.\n•\t They are an effective way for an existing church to extend their\nreach. Churches who implement a multisite model can extend\ntheir mission and vision to a different geographical area. In\nmany cases, the campus is an area that already has people\nwho attend the main campus. The church can start with a\nbuilt-in launch team that understands the church’s vision,\nmission, and strategy. Many multisite churches embrace the\nmotto, “One church in multiple locations.”\n•\t They can be personality driven. One drawback is that multisite\ncampuses can be built around a single personality, especially\nif the lead teaching pastor is the same for all campuses. When\nthe church is built upon one personality, the church can suffer\nwhen that person is no longer there.\n•\t They can lack contextualization. Another drawback is that\nthis model can create “cookie cutter” churches that are not\nproperly contextualized. When an existing church’s vision\nand mission is “imported” in a different geographical context,\nit may not be a good fit for that location. Just because a church\nmodel and strategy are successful in one setting doesn’t guar­\nantee it will be effective in another.\n# R E P L A N T\nThe replant process involves the decision to close an existing church\nand relaunch as a new church, with new leadership, a new name,\nnew governance, and a new ministry approach. In this model, a\ndying church avoids permanent death by recognizing it will no longer\nflourish unless conditions drastically change to facilitate growth.\n# ADVANTAGES\n•\t Builds on the history or legacy of the previous church. This may\nhelp those who would prefer the status quo and recognizes\nthe church’s past impact in the community.\n•\t A new identity creates momentum. Establishing a new identity\nin the community can create momentum, enthusiasm, and\ninterest in the replant.\n•\t Offers a break with the past and a fresh start for the future. Setting\nan end date and a launch date avoids permanent death of\nthe church.\n•\t Requires a new leader and a decision-making structure. To\nreplant, a new leader and new structure and approach for\nmaking decisions must be in place.\n•\t Those in power may reject the new leadership structure. A new\nleadership structure is sometimes rejected by those in power.\n•\t Patience is essential. The average turnaround time for a replant\nis 5–7 years, so patience is key.\n# F I N A L C O N S I D E R AT I O N S\nLearn and implement the strengths of different models. There are\nstrengths and challenges of every model. While you may operate\nfrom one model, it is helpful to incorporate the strengths from other\nmodels. Perhaps in your context you should consider a hybrid that\ntakes the best of multiple models and implements them to suit your\nneeds for **multiplication**.\nPick a model that fits who you are and where you are. Do not import\na model from another leader or context. When considering church\n**multiplication**, leaders are often guilty of attending a conference or\nvisiting another church and concluding that they want to plant the\nchurch they have seen or heard about in their context. But resist the\ntemptation to import a model from outside your context. Pick a model\nthat fits your giftedness and your context.\nRemember the model is just a tool, not the target. We live in a highly\npragmatic culture and want to know what works. We want to utilize\nthe products or approaches that produce the best results. But the\nmodels are simply tools. Don’t put your faith in them to produce\nresults only God can produce. Instead, focus your faith on the calling\nthat God has put on your life for a particular place and people group."])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"18:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mx-auto max-w-4xl\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mdx-content prose prose-lg md:prose-xl prose-slate dark:prose-invert mx-auto prose-headings:font-bold prose-headings:tracking-tight prose-h1:text-4xl prose-h1:mb-8 prose-h2:text-2xl prose-h2:mt-12 prose-h2:mb-6 prose-h3:text-xl prose-h3:mt-8 prose-h3:mb-4 prose-p:text-lg prose-p:leading-8 prose-p:mb-6 prose-strong:text-blue-600 dark:prose-strong:text-blue-400 prose-em:text-gray-600 dark:prose-em:text-gray-400 prose-li:text-lg prose-li:leading-8 prose-li:mb-2 prose-blockquote:border-l-blue-500 prose-blockquote:bg-blue-50/50 dark:prose-blockquote:bg-blue-950/20 prose-blockquote:px-6 prose-blockquote:py-4 prose-blockquote:rounded-r-lg max-w-none\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"space-y-6 text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 leading-relaxed [\u0026\u003e*:first-child]:mt-0\",\"children\":\"$1a\"}]}]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"19:[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"mt-20 pt-8 border-t border-gray-200/50 dark:border-gray-800/50\",\"children\":[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex justify-between items-center\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"text-sm text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"children\":[\"Chapter \",12,\" of the ReThink Book\"]}],[\"$\",\"p\",null,{\"className\":\"mt-1\",\"children\":[\"By \",\"$undefined\"]}]]}],[\"$\",\"div\",null,{\"className\":\"flex space-x-4\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"button\",null,{\"className\":\"inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 elegant-transition border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 bg-background hover:bg-surface hover:text-text-primary h-9 rounded-md px-3 glass-card\",\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"svg\",null,{\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"xmlns\":\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",\"width\":24,\"height\":24,\"viewBox\":\"0 0 24 24\",\"fill\":\"none\",\"stroke\":\"currentColor\",\"strokeWidth\":2,\"strokeLinecap\":\"round\",\"strokeLinejoin\":\"round\",\"className\":\"lucide lucide-arrow-left w-4 h-4 mr-2\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"path\",\"1l729n\",{\"d\":\"m12 19-7-7 7-7\"}],[\"$\",\"path\",\"x3x0zl\",{\"d\":\"M19 12H5\"}],\"$undefined\"]}],\"Previous\"]}],[\"$\",\"button\",null,{\"className\":\"inline-flex items-center justify-center whitespace-nowrap text-sm font-medium ring-offset-background transition-colors focus-visible:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring focus-visible:ring-offset-2 disabled:pointer-events-none disabled:opacity-50 elegant-transition border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-700 bg-background hover:bg-surface hover:text-text-primary h-9 rounded-md px-3 glass-card\",\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"children\":[\"Next\",[\"$\",\"svg\",null,{\"ref\":\"$undefined\",\"xmlns\":\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",\"width\":24,\"height\":24,\"viewBox\":\"0 0 24 24\",\"fill\":\"none\",\"stroke\":\"currentColor\",\"strokeWidth\":2,\"strokeLinecap\":\"round\",\"strokeLinejoin\":\"round\",\"className\":\"lucide lucide-arrow-right w-4 h-4 ml-2\",\"children\":[[\"$\",\"path\",\"1ays0h\",{\"d\":\"M5 12h14\"}],[\"$\",\"path\",\"xquz4c\",{\"d\":\"m12 5 7 7-7 7\"}],\"$undefined\"]}]]}]]}]]}]}]\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"d:[[\"$\",\"meta\",\"0\",{\"charSet\":\"utf-8\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"viewport\",\"content\":\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\"}]]\n9:null\n"])</script><script>self.__next_f.push([1,"b:{\"metadata\":[[\"$\",\"title\",\"0\",{\"children\":\"Fluid Dark Elegance - Premium Business Solutions\"}],[\"$\",\"meta\",\"1\",{\"name\":\"description\",\"content\":\"Sophisticated business solutions designed for executive excellence.
