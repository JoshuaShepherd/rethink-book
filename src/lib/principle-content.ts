“The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who
cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn,
unlearn, and relearn.” —Alvin Toffler
When bringing about change in the way people behave, we often
need to start with questions of “why” before considering the practical
issues of “how.” In the book Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire
Everyone to *Take Action*, Simon Sinek contends that there are two
primary ways to influence human behavior: you can either manip­
ulate it or inspire it. While manipulation is not always negative, for
example when a retailer drops the price of a product to motivate a
purchase, it often involves the use of fear or peer pressure to influ­
ence behavior. Additionally, change that is manipulated is usually
short-lived.
Inspiring change, on the other hand, involves the consideration of
deeper issues. We need to ask underlying questions of “why.” Why
do we perceive things in a particular way? Why do we behave in a
certain manner? What are the motivations or inherent factors that
undergird our behaviors?
Ronald Heifetz deals with similar issues of change in Leadership
Without Easy Answers, making a distinction between organizational
change and cultural change. He argues that organizational change
typically involves restructuring, along with the use of new programs,
processes, and techniques. Cultural change, however, looks at how
to create a new culture or environment, which will require a new
set of skills and capacities. By connecting the themes of these two
books, we can say that cultural change is about starting with the
“why,” while organizational change is more about the practical issues
of “how.”
This topic of change is important in church **multiplication** because
responses to the crises of the church in North America will not be
organizational changes. We can’t settle with minor adjustments in
our **ecclesiology**, how we do church. The problem is deeply rooted.
We must rethink to make cultural changes and ask the “why” ques­
tions. The underlying issues are primarily spiritual, theological,
and **missiological**. If we want to plant disciple-making, **missional**
churches that have a mindset of **multiplication**, it will take deep
cultural change in the way we think about God’s mission and the
nature of the church, as well as how the church lives out that mis­
sion in local contexts. We must change our attitude from “we have
never done it that way before” to “whatever it takes.”
Another way to frame the rethinking discussion is by using the
language of paradigm. The word paradigm commonly refers to a
perception, assumption, or frame of reference. In a general sense,
it’s how we see the world in terms of perception, understanding,
and interpreting.
Every organization, including the church, is built upon underlying
paradigms or assumptions. This is not the same thing as the church’s
beliefs or theological systems. Rather, the paradigm determines how
an organization thinks and acts. Paradigms explain behavior then
guide behavior. If we try to restructure an organization but leave the
original paradigms in place, then little will change. For real change
to take place, we need a paradigm shift or, in most cases, multiple
paradigm shifts.
A paradigm shift occurs when there is a fundamental change in
an underlying assumption. It’s a change from one way of thinking
to another, a rethinking. There is a transformation, a sort of meta­
morphosis that takes place. For the church to move from a mindset
of addition (simply planting growing churches) to one of multipli­
cation (planting reproducing churches), the church must rethink
several key shifts in the way we think and the way we behave.
While it isn’t complicated, it is certainly multifaceted.
When I first wrote Rethink, I shared 9 paradigm shifts to activate
the church. Since that time and based on the feedback I have
received from church leaders, that initial list has grown. In this
revised and expanded version, I now unpack 12 **missiological** prin­
ciples we must rethink to activate the people of God to engage in
His redemptive mission. Separately, none of these principles are
a cure-all for what ails the church in North America. However, as
we begin to think and act differently, I believe there is a synergistic
effect within these missionary arenas that will lead to multiplica­
tion of disciples and churches.
The strategies and models that fit earlier eras of church history are
simply no longer effective. What we need now is a new set of tools.
We need a fresh perspective—a new paradigm—and must rethink
church **multiplication**, especially as it relates to our understanding
of the church, mission, and church planting.`,

> "Mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an attribute of God." —David Bosch
The most foundational **missiological** shift that must take place for
# PRINCIPLE 1: RETHINK THE MISSIONARY NATURE OF GOD'

“Mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an
attribute of God.” —David Bosch
many Christians relates to their understanding of the missionary
nature of God and the church. Let’s first consider the missionary
nature of God then discuss implications on the way we understand
the church.
When we think about the attributes of God, we most often think of
characteristics such as holiness, sovereignty, wisdom, justice, love, and
so forth. Rarely do we think of God’s missionary nature. But Scripture
teaches that God is a missionary God, a sending God.
The missionary nature of God can be framed in two primary ways.
The first involves the grand narrative of Scripture. When we consider
the grand story or metanarrative of Scripture, we discover it is about
God’s redemptive purposes. All Scripture and doctrines of biblical faith
connect around God’s grand plan and purpose for creation. Mission
is the central theme describing God’s activity throughout history to
restore creation. The mission of God unifies the Bible from creation
to new creation.1
A second way to recognize God’s missionary nature is to examine the
“sending language” throughout the Bible. From God sending Abram
in Genesis 12 to the sending of His angel in Revelation 22, hundreds
of sending examples portray God as a missionary-sending God. The
Hebrew verb **shelach**, meaning “to send,” is found nearly 800 times in
the Old Testament. While it is often used in a variety of non-theological
sayings and phrases, it is employed more than 200 times with God as
the subject of the verb. In other words, God commissions and sends.
Exodus 3:10-15 contains a fascinating dialogue surrounding God’s
prompting of Moses to confront Pharaoh. God is sending Moses to
convince the king of Egypt to release the Israelites from bondage. In
the six verses, there are five references to sending.
“So now go, I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the
Israelites out of Egypt.” But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that
I should go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?”
And God said, “I will be with you. And this will be the sign to
you that it is I who have sent you: When you have brought the
people out of Egypt, you will worship God on this mountain.”
Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to
them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they
ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?” God
said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to
the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’ ” God also said to Moses,
“Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has
sent me to you’ ” (emphasis added).
The prominence of sending language is not only seen in Genesis and
Exodus but throughout the historical, poetic, and prophetic books of
the Old Testament. God is a sending God. Especially when you consider
the prophets, it is easy to see that they were sent by God to participate
in His redemptive purposes. Perhaps the most dramatic illustration
of sending in the Old Testament is found in Isaiah 6. In this passage,
we catch a glimpse of God’s sending nature in its **trinitarian** fullness.
“Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, ‘Whom shall I send? And
who will go for us?’ And I said, ‘Here am I. Send me!’” (Isaiah 6:8,
emphasis added).
Later in Isaiah 61:1-3, it is interesting to note that there are no fewer
than seven acts of redemption that proceed from or depend on the
Hebrew verb “sent.” To emphasize how central the sending theme
is, the passage could be rendered this way:
> He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,
> He has sent me to proclaim freedom for the captives,
> He has sent me to release from darkness for the prisoners,
> He has sent me to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor and
> the day of vengeance of our God,
> He has sent me to comfort all who mourn,
> He has sent me to provide for those who grieve in Zion,
> He has sent me to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead
> of ashes, the oil of joy instead of mourning, and a garment of
> praise instead of a spirit of despair.
> Jesus applies this passage to His own ministry in Luke 4:18-19 as He
> claims to be the fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1-3. These verses become, in
> a sense, the personal mission statement for Jesus.
> The Old Testament ends with God promising to send a special
> messenger as the forerunner of the Messiah: “I will send my messenger”
> (Malachi 3:1, emphasis added). The New Testament begins with the
> arrival of that messenger in the person of John the Baptist, described
> in the Gospels as “a man sent from God” (John 1:6).
> In the New Testament, sending language is found not only in the
> Gospels but throughout Acts and the Epistles. The most comprehensive
> collection of sending language, however, is found in the Gospel of
> John, where the word send or sent is used nearly 60 times. Most uses
> refer to God as the “one who sends” and Jesus as the “one who is sent.”
> We see God the Father sending the Son, God the Father and the Son
> sending the Spirit, and God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit sending
> the church. In the final sending passage in John, Jesus makes clear
> that He is not only sent by the Father but now He is the sender, as
> He sends the disciples: “As the Father has sent me, I am sending you”
> (John 20:21, emphasis added).
> With this sentence, Jesus draws more than a vague parallel between His
> mission and ours. Deliberately and precisely, He makes His mission the
> model for ours. Our understanding of the church’s mission must flow
> from our understanding of Jesus’ mission as revealed in the Gospels.`,

“No strategy will reach every kind of person except
a strategy that mobilizes every kind of person.”
> —Brian Sanders
Church **multiplication** and church planting take many different
forms; therefore, defining the models is a difficult task. However,
as we discuss how to rethink church **multiplication**, here are four
approaches in the church planting landscape.
•	 Contemporary attractional or launch
•	 **missional** communities or microchurches
•	 Campus or multisite
•	 Replant
# C O N T E M P O R A R Y AT T R A C T I O N A L
# O R L A U N C H
In a contemporary attractional or launch model, a church planter
begins with a launch team. In some cases, the church plant may
even begin with a small staff. This model seeks to build a core group,
usually 30–50 people, which will become their launch team. Often
there is a “sending church” that is large enough to send the people
that make up the initial team.
Once a launch team is formed, the church will conduct a series of
preview services to give the target community a picture of what
the church will be like before it goes public. In some cases, a church
plant may refer to this as a “soft launch,” where the core group holds
corporate gatherings that are less publicized to increase the size of the
launch team and build momentum. At the time of the “hard” launch,
the church will send out a mass-mailer or other marketing to invite
the community to attend the new church.
Because much of church planting over the past four decades has been
focused in suburban areas populated by middle to upper class families,
the launch model has been effective. However, it has lost some of its
effectiveness in areas saturated by other contemporary churches. And
as North America is increasingly becoming a missionary context, the
percentage of people open to this kind of church plant is declining.
# ADVANTAGES
Launching large breaks growth barriers. Begin small, and chances
are the church will remain small. But start large, and the church will
break growth barriers quicker. One effective way to shatter growth
barriers is with momentum created by launching large. Momentum is
one of a planter’s best tools for growth. Launching large can produce
tremendous momentum.
Launching large provides credibility. When a first-time guest walks into
a new church and sees a large crowd, they immediately sense that
something good is happening, and the credibility of the church increases.
Launching large facilitates financial sustainability. By launching with
a large group, the church may be able to quickly become financially
sustainable. Learning to effectively raise funds and creating a well
planned budget for a new church are foundational for launching
large and becoming self-sustaining within a couple of years.
# POSSIBLE DISADVANTAGES
Launching large has a higher cost. On the flip side of becoming finan­
cially sustainable faster, it costs more to launch a large church. Further,
many expenses will be up front, including rent for a meeting space,
sound system and video equipment, computers, musical instruments,
and supplies for children’s ministry. Marketing for the launch is
another significant financial commitment.
Launching large can be stressful. Beginning with a church of 100 or
more people will create challenges with assimilation, programming,
and development. Because of the potential to start with a large
group, the planting team will need systems in place prior to the first
public service. Rather than simply going through a worship service,
plans will have to be made for children, parking, group space, and
so forth before the church opens its doors. This can be stressful and
time-consuming.
# M I S S I O N A L C O M M U N I T I E S
# O R M I C R O C H U R C H E S
Proponents of a **missional** community or microchurch model propose
that when starting a new church, you should begin with missionary
activity and not with the corporate gathering. Church planting over
the past several decades has really focused on a church service. When
the emphasis is on the large gathering, we can lose focus on what God
is doing in the surrounding context. Further, because many people
today are less interested in the programs and activities of the church,
starting a church by attempting to attract people to attend a corporate
gathering may prove to be difficult.
# WHAT IS A **missional** COMMUNITY?
**missional** communities are not smaller church services, Bible studies,
small groups, or other programs of the church. Instead, **missional**
communities are the church. Those who follow this model will gather
their **missional** communities into a corporate setting once there are
three or more communities. They may meet once a month then choose
to gather on a weekly basis.
Many have been so conditioned by what they have experienced through
typical church activities that they naturally seek to make **missional**
communities fit what they have known before. Other programs and
activities of the church are great for the purposes they serve, but they
do not generally deliver on the purposes of **missional** communities.
A **missional** community is a committed group of Jesus followers, the
size of an extended family (12–25 people), and empowered by the
Spirit to participate in God’s mission of redemption in a particular
neighborhood and/or network. Hopefully, this definition offers a
framework to differentiate a **missional** community from a traditional
small group. It is important as you define what a **missional** commu­
nity looks like in your context that you are not too prescriptive. In
other words, allow each **missional** community to be unique to their
context and mission. All **missional** communities will not, and should
not, look alike.
# MICROCHURCHES
While microchurches share several characteristics with **missional**
communities, there are a couple differences. Like **missional** communities,
microchurches see mission as the organizing principle of their existence.
However, microchurches not only focus on specific neighborhoods
and networks of relationships but engage in specific problems. These
areas of **missional** engagement could include poverty issues, human
trafficking, education, crime, homelessness, mental health, and other
areas of brokenness where gospel restoration is needed.
The language of microchurch provides a broader umbrella to encom­
pass a variety of church expressions. How and where microchurches
gather and engage their **missional** contexts will be different. Some
will meet in their homes, as that approach often makes sense for
reaching a neighborhood or a social network. Others will meet
in coffee shops, cafés, community centers, apartment complexes,
and the like.
Like **missional** communities, microchurches will not, and should
not, look alike. Perhaps the greatest distinction between a **missional**
community and a microchurch is that microchurches are seen as
the church in its smallest, most nimble, and potent expression. Most
**missional** communities are closely “tethered” to the larger church.
**missional** communities are seen by many as an outreach expression
of the church.
Microchurches, on the other hand, give special emphasis to empow­
ering people to use their gifts and resources to engage in God’s redemp­
tive mission. They provide an opportunity for localized leaders to
create and contextualize expressions of the church. They give both
the license to lead and creative control. This does not negate the
benefits of networking microchurches together for the sake of training,
coaching, accountability, and movement. However, those resources
exist to support the microchurches, not for the microchurches to
support the network.
# ADVANTAGES
•	 They are highly relational. Both **missional** communities and
microchurches network and build bridges throughout the
community, including neighborhoods, businesses, schools,
non-profits, local government, and so forth.
•	 They disciple their way into church planting. By loving and
serving people through a growing network of relationships,
a **missional** community or microchurch will create space for
people to belong before they believe. In this space **discipleship**
happens, which in turn leads to the **multiplication** of churches,
not the other way around.
•	 They are a better fit for certain contexts. A **missional** commu­
nity or microchurch approach is more conducive in urban
contexts, along with places where meeting space is limited
or expensive. The relational aspect is also more fruitful in
post-Christian environments.
•	 Slower growth. The nature of a relational, disciple-making
approach inherently leads to slower growth. A church planter
that employs this model needs to have a long “runway”
perspective.
•	 Financial stability. Because of the grassroots nature of this
approach, the church plant may not experience financial
sustainability for several years. However, because bivocational
or covocational leadership best fits this model, the church plant
may be in a position to focus on steady, long-term growth.
# C A M P U S O R M U LT I S I T E
Many churches find the campus or multisite model, compared to
building larger facilities, more fiscally wise and sustainable.
# ADVANTAGES
•	 They are well resourced. Multisite churches are usually well
resourced—fiscally, organizationally, structurally, and profes­
sionally—because they are connected to a main campus. This
connection strengthens the foundation of the new campus.
Multisite and satellite campuses can also be a great incubator
for developing emerging leaders.
•	 They are an effective way for an existing church to extend their
reach. Churches who implement a multisite model can extend
their mission and vision to a different geographical area. In
many cases, the campus is an area that already has people
who attend the main campus. The church can start with a
built-in launch team that understands the church’s vision,
mission, and strategy. Many multisite churches embrace the
motto, “One church in multiple locations.”
•	 They can be personality driven. One drawback is that multisite
campuses can be built around a single personality, especially
if the lead teaching pastor is the same for all campuses. When
the church is built upon one personality, the church can suffer
when that person is no longer there.
•	 They can lack contextualization. Another drawback is that
this model can create “cookie cutter” churches that are not
properly contextualized. When an existing church’s vision
and mission is “imported” in a different geographical context,
it may not be a good fit for that location. Just because a church
model and strategy are successful in one setting doesn’t guar­
antee it will be effective in another.
# R E P L A N T
The replant process involves the decision to close an existing church
and relaunch as a new church, with new leadership, a new name,
new governance, and a new ministry approach. In this model, a
dying church avoids permanent death by recognizing it will no longer
flourish unless conditions drastically change to facilitate growth.
# ADVANTAGES
•	 Builds on the history or legacy of the previous church. This may
help those who would prefer the status quo and recognizes
the church’s past impact in the community.
•	 A new identity creates momentum. Establishing a new identity
in the community can create momentum, enthusiasm, and
interest in the replant.
•	 Offers a break with the past and a fresh start for the future. Setting
an end date and a launch date avoids permanent death of
the church.
•	 Requires a new leader and a decision-making structure. To
replant, a new leader and new structure and approach for
making decisions must be in place.
•	 Those in power may reject the new leadership structure. A new
leadership structure is sometimes rejected by those in power.
•	 Patience is essential. The average turnaround time for a replant
is 5–7 years, so patience is key.
# F I N A L C O N S I D E R AT I O N S
Learn and implement the strengths of different models. There are
strengths and challenges of every model. While you may operate
from one model, it is helpful to incorporate the strengths from other
models. Perhaps in your context you should consider a hybrid that
takes the best of multiple models and implements them to suit your
needs for **multiplication**.
Pick a model that fits who you are and where you are. Do not import
a model from another leader or context. When considering church
**multiplication**, leaders are often guilty of attending a conference or
visiting another church and concluding that they want to plant the
church they have seen or heard about in their context. But resist the
temptation to import a model from outside your context. Pick a model
that fits your giftedness and your context.
Remember the model is just a tool, not the target. We live in a highly
pragmatic culture and want to know what works. We want to utilize
the products or approaches that produce the best results. But the
models are simply tools. Don’t put your faith in them to produce
results only God can produce. Instead, focus your faith on the calling
that God has put on your life for a particular place and people group.`,

“If we fail at engaging well and living as Christ would live
among our neighbors and friends, we fail as missionaries
and the culture doesn’t see the visible beauty of the sent
church.” —Hugh Halter
Traditionally, we start with church then disciple people and send them
on mission if we want to see **multiplication**. But, in a post-Christian
context, we must start with **discipleship** and mission then work
toward church. The most effective approach to **multiplication** is to
begin with missionary activity.
This is what is meant by the phrase missionary flow. It’s a simple way
to rethink the flow or direction of starting a new church. We need
a new framework, a new way to think about planting that doesn’t
begin with Sunday.28

Community
Structuring
Congregation
Let’s consider each circle individually.
# E N G A G I N G C O N T E X T
Too often church **multiplication** starts with Christians from another
church or they gather disconnected believers from around a city.
This is well-intentioned and might be better than nothing at all, but
in most cases, this is simply starting a church with a church. This is
not what we are talking about with missionary flow. Missionary flow
means starting from scratch.
The first phase of any mission must involve contextualization, under­
standing the local setting so you can best engage people relationally.
Along with understanding the context, we need to remember that
we are a sent, missionary people. In other words, we have already
been sent into our neighborhoods. We have already been sent to our
workplaces. We have already been sent to the social spaces we inhabit
each day. We don’t have to wait, wondering where God might send
us. Instead, we already live, work, and play in these places for the
purpose of God’s mission.
This is where our church **multiplication** efforts need to start. We must
identify the places and people to whom God has sent us. Incarnate
into those places. Pray and listen for what God is doing. Discern how
He wants us to participate as we begin to understand, relate to, and
connect with people. Start with **discipleship** and mission and work
toward church.
# C U LT I VAT I N G C O M M U N I T Y
The word cultivating speaks to the idea of nurturing. When we culti­
vate soil, we prepare it for planting. We have no power to make crops
grow, but we can nurture conditions that will increase the likelihood
for growth. Cultivating community is similar. We can’t make commu­
nity happen, but we can create opportunities and environments in
which community can flourish.
We use the word community to make a distinction from the more
customary word church. Cultivating community involves creating
time and space for people to connect relationally with you but also
with each other. The key is that this space is not seen as a church
but instead as a place where relationships are developed. When
relationships begin to develop, you are building “social momentum.”
Examine the updated missionary flow and notice two additional
phrases and arrows.
Engaging
Context
Social Momentum
Spiritual Momentum
Community
# S O C I A L M O M E N T U M
Social momentum creates spaces for Christians and non-Christians
to connect, do life together, and build relational equity before they
consider attending a church. Unless we create a consistent, gathering
environment—between engaging context and structuring congre­
gation—that people can be invited to and be part of, we will never
experience social momentum in our missionary engagement.
Here is another way to think about it. Most church planters are good
at engaging context. They work at getting to know their neighbors.
They are intentional about making connections in coffee shops or at
the gym. They pay careful attention at their workplaces for oppor­
tunities to make friends with coworkers. However, if there isn’t an
ongoing, somewhat informal “get-together” for the planter to invite
people to, they will simply have lots of surface connections that never
move beyond being acquaintances. After making connections with
new people, many church planters don’t have a clear vision of what
to do next relationally. Too often, the step taken is to start a Sunday
morning worship service so there is a church activity to which new
people can be invited.
Now, there is certainly nothing wrong with inviting people to church,
but in a missionary context, we need to consider an intermediate or
in-between relational step. There must be regular, relational spaces to
which we can easily and naturally invite people. Without a consistent
space to welcome the people we have met while engaging in our
context, we will never develop social momentum. Instead, we will
simply have relational connections that never move beyond knowing
each other by name.
So, what do those relational spaces look like? We need to find some­
thing we are already doing, or at least like to do, and develop a
consistent rhythm where we can easily invite someone to join. For
example, maybe you have a fire pit in your backyard that you light
every Saturday night. Maybe it is a game night once a week or once a
month in your home. Schedule a neighborhood potluck once a month.
Sharing meals is always a great idea.
The point is that when you have an ongoing relational event, it is
natural to invite those you are trying to connect with. You could say
to a coworker or neighbor, “Hey, on the first Saturday night of every
month, we have a group of friends over to roast hot dogs and make
s’mores around the fire pit. You are always welcome to join us.”
Creating time and space to develop social momentum will provide a
necessary opportunity for Christians and non-Christians to begin the
process of cultivating community within a neighborhood or network.
# S P I R I T U A L M O M E N T U M
Now, back to missionary flow.
The new arrow coming out of cultivating community is spiritual
momentum. Much like developing social momentum, we need to
think about creating time and space but, in this case, to provide
opportunities for people to grow spiritually.
Engaging
Context
Community
It may be as simple as gathering to pray for one another, read through
the Gospels, or discuss what Scripture says regarding current events.
If we are truly doing life with unbelievers and developing social
momentum, then there will be those who desire deeper, more mean­
ingful conversations. It should be natural and easy to say to someone
that you have a group of friends that meet once a week to pray for
each other and talk about spiritual things.
If we are starting with and connecting exclusively with non-Christians,
the group that provides spiritual momentum may be something brand
new. In other words, it may be formed directly out of the time and
space created to develop social momentum. However, if we have a
group of Christians who are a part of a church planting team, this
spiritual momentum group may be a **missional** community to which
we invite that person.
# S T R U C T U R I N G C O N G R E G AT I O N
The final circle is structuring congregation. There will come a time
to form or structure a congregation. There will be many issues to
consider, such as governance, meeting rhythms, administration,
budgets, staffing, and so forth.
Don’t forget that we are talking about the importance of thinking like
a missionary. Church **multiplication** is the outworking of mission and
community. Structuring a congregation is the outworking of engaging
context and cultivating community. Church **multiplication** is the point
where mission and community intersect. At the heart of God’s plan
to bless the nations are the people of God. The church is formed by
mission and is formed for mission.`,

What if our church saw as its goal the Kingdom of God in­
stead of the number of bodies it gathered and organized
into straight rows? —Jeff Christopherson
In the 1950s, a 33-year-old left-handed pitcher made major league
baseball history. Harvey Haddix struck out 27 consecutive batters.
After nine innings, the scoreboard read all zeroes. No runs, no hits,
no errors, no walks.
But Harvey’s teammates forgot something amid their excitement
over his historic performance. The scoreboard had another zero. The
game was not over. It was tied. Harvey would go on to pitch another
amazing three innings, 12 full innings of perfect pitching.
So, why have so few people heard of Harvey Haddix and arguably
the greatest game ever pitched? Because he lost the game. Harvey’s
team failed to score, and the Braves ultimately reached the plate in
the thirteenth inning because of an error.29
What does this 1950s baseball game have to do with the church in
North America? I would argue that it is entirely possible for church
leaders to have impressive statistics regarding filled seats and still lose
the game because they have little to no effect in their community. It’s
possible to grow a “great” church but fail to make disciples. It doesn’t
have to be this way. Church leaders must stop being enamored with
just one side of the scoreboard.
# T H E T H R E E C O M M O N M E T R I C S
When it comes to “keeping score,” churches in North America typically
focus on three metrics: buildings, budgets, and butts. While there is
nothing inherently wrong with counting these things, we do need to
ask if keeping score of how big our buildings are, how much money
people give, and how many people show up is the best indicator of
how a church is doing. Do these metrics really measure how incar­
nationally the body of Christ is living?
The fact is that these three metrics give us no real sense of the influ­
ence a church has on its community. Do the number of people who
attend a Sunday morning gathering give you any indication of the
impact the church is having on individual neighborhoods or the city?
The answer is a resounding no! There is no correlation between the
number of people who show up for an event and the difference those
people are making where they live. The same is true with how much
money people give to the church and how large a church’s buildings
are. The reason we “count” those three things is because they are easy
to count. But we must rethink to not count what is easy but measure
what is important.
# C O U N T I N G A N D M E A S U R I N G
While we often use the language of “counting” and “measuring”
interchangeably, there is a difference between the two. We must make
the distinction because the church has largely been in the counting
business, which has negatively influenced the way we think about
the nature of the church and limited our **multiplication** and impact
in the world. We need to move to measuring more and counting less.
Counting gives attention to numbers. The question is “How many?”
It is quantitative. Conversations about “How many?” are frequently
conversations about resources but can also be about activities. Conver­
sations about resources, in a time of limited resources, become conver­
sations about sufficiency, “Do we have enough?” or, “How can we get
more?” Examples could include finances or people. We ask questions
like, “Do we have enough money for that mission?” or “Do we have
enough volunteers for that ministry?” A quantitative question about
activities might be, “How many Bible studies took place this week?”
Measuring gives attention to change. When measuring, the question is
“How far?” It is qualitative. Conversations about “How far?” frequently
involve change that can be measured over a particular time, as
in, “How far have we come over the past year?” “Has the quality of
something changed over time? Has something gotten better, or worse,
since the last time we measured?”
There is a need for both counting and measuring. In all complex
organizations, multiple tools are needed. However, like all tools, the
right tool must be chosen for the job at hand. So, what should we
count and what should we measure?
I hesitate to be too prescriptive because contexts are different. But
let me suggest some possibilities that will hopefully crack open your
imagination for metrics that fit your community. Think of these as
conversation starters for the scorecard your church should be tracking.
# C O U N T I N G
One of the things we should count are missionary behaviors. For
example:
•	 How many neighbors have I gotten to know by name in the
past month?
•	 How many coworkers have I gotten to know on a deeper level?
•	 How many people have I had in my home this past month?
•	 How many meals have I shared with people outside my church
family this week?
•	 How many times this week have I intentionally been a blessing
to someone?
What other missionary behaviors can you track that would help you
see if your church was living with gospel intentionality?
*In **missional** Renaissance*, Reggie Mc Neal suggests developing new
scorecards around six resources of the church: prayer, people, time,
finances, facilities, and technology. Here are a few ideas from each
category to rethink outside the walls of the church.30
Prayer
•	 Number of people being prayed for both inside and outside
the church
•	 Number of people prayed with during the week by church
members
•	 Number of prayer meetings conducted off church property
•	 Number of prayer answers reported back to the church
•	 Number of community leaders adopted and prayed for each
week
•	 Number of prayer walks taken in the community or
neighborhoods
•	 Number of prayer cards received from community prayer
boxes
•	 Time spent in prayer in staff meetings for community needs
•	 Number of times each week school teachers are prayed for/
over
People
•	 Number of people engaged in financial planning
•	 Number of people growing in financial giving to kingdom
causes
•	 Number of people engaged in daily spiritual formation
•	 Number of people pursuing an intentional learning agenda
•	 Number of people reporting increased friendships over time
•	 Number of people sent into trailer parks, apartments, retire­
ment centers
•	 Number of community ministries adopted by church groups
or classes
•	 Number of people serving other people in some venue
•	 Number of people serving as mentors
•	 Number of people practicing an intentional blessing strategy
Time and Calendar
•	 Amount of time spent debriefing people engaged in commu­
nity service
•	 Time spent in mentoring people in the community beyond
the church`,

    content: `# PRINCIPLE 2: RETHINK THE MISSIONARY NATURE OF THE CHURCH

“Following Jesus into the mission field is either impossible
or extremely difficult for the vast majority of congrega­
tions in the Western world because of one thing: They
have a systems story that will not allow them to take the
first step out of the institution into the mission field, even
though the mission field is just outside the door of the
congregation.” —Bill Easum
Now that we have discussed the missionary nature of God, why is it
important for us to recapture God’s missionary nature in the grand
narrative of Scripture? Why should we consider God as a missionary
God by examining sending language in the Bible? If God is a missionary
God (and He is!), then we as His people are missionary people. The
nature and essence of the church is rooted in the missionary nature
of God. Another way to articulate this truth is to say that the church
doesn’t just send missionaries; the church is the missionary.
Individually and collectively as the body of Christ, we are a sent,
missionary church. We should be sending people in the church out
among people of the world rather than attempting to attract people
of the world in among people of the church. The reason we start with
this crucial distinction is because most people in the church today
do not think of their congregation in a sending, missionary manner.
# R E F O R M AT I O N H E R I TA G E V I E W
People today understand the church in two prominent ways. The first
view is what some call the “Reformation heritage” perspective.2 The
main idea behind this understanding of the church is that Protestants
have inherited a particular view of church from the Reformers, which
emphasizes the right preaching of the Word, the right administration
of the ordinances, and the proper exercise of church discipline.
Historically these have been referred to as the “marks” of the church.
While each of the three marks are important aspects of church life, this
view has left us with an understanding of the church as a place where
certain things happen. In other words, a person goes to church to
hear the Bible taught, to participate in the Lord’s Supper and baptism,
and, in some cases, to experience church discipline. Once again, all
very good things, but is that the way we want to define the church?
Do these marks speak to the real essence and nature of the church?
# C O N T E M P O R A R Y VA R I AT I O N V I E W
The second view is a slight variation on the Reformation heritage defi­
nition. The contemporary variation view is perhaps the most prevalent
way people in North America understand the church today, as a vendor
of religious goods and services. From this perspective, members are
viewed more as customers for whom religious goods and services are
produced. Churchgoers expect the church to provide a wide range of
religious services, such as great worship music, preaching, children’s
programs, small groups, parenting seminars, and so forth.
One of the key issues with both views of defining the church is that
the church is seen as an institution that exists for the benefit of its
members.
The church should not be viewed as a place where certain marks must
occur or as a consumer interaction that provides services. The nature
of the church—rooted in the very nature of God—is missionary. The
church is a people called and sent by God to participate in His redemp­
tive mission in the world. Rather than seeing ourselves primarily as
a sending body, we must see ourselves as a body that is sent.
Of course, the church still gathers, but the difference is that we don’t
simply gather for our own sake, but for the sake of others, or better
yet, for the sake of God’s mission. We come together as a collective
body to be equipped through prayer, worship, and study to then be
sent out into the world. The church is meant to be a gathered and
scattered people.
Missionary Lesslie Newbigin stated it this way, “The church is not
meant to call men and women out of the world into a safe religious
enclave but to call them out in order to send them back as agents of
God’s kingship.”
# W H Y T H I S M AT T E R S
To grasp the importance of understanding the church as missionary,
consider the idea of cultural distance. This is a simple missionary
tool to help discern just how far a person or a people group is from a
meaningful engagement with the gospel. This image provides a visual.
Notice the number scale. Each numeral with the prefix m indicates
a significant cultural barrier to the meaningful communication of
the gospel. Barriers include such things as language, race, history,
worldview, traditions, beliefs, political affiliation, and so forth. The
greater the number of cultural barriers, the increased complexity
there will be in communicating with another person.
In The Forgotten Ways: Reactivating the ***missional** Church*, Alan Hirsch
offers a description of how the scale might look in a local context.
•	 m0–m1: People in this group have some concept of Christianity.
They would speak the same language, have similar interests,
are probably the same nationality, and are from a similar
class grouping. Most of your friends would probably fit into
this group.
•	 m1–m2: This group includes the average non-Christian,
someone who has little awareness of or interest in Christianity
and is somewhat suspicious of the church. This category might
also include those previously offended by a bad experience
of church or Christians.
•	 m2–m3: People in this group have no idea about Christianity
or might be part of an ethnic group with different religious
impulses or a fringe subculture. This group will include people
antagonistic toward Christianity as they understand or have
experienced it.
•	 m3–m4: This group might be inhabited by ethnic and religious
groupings such as Muslims or Jews. The fact that they are in
the West might ameliorate some of the distance, but just about
everything else gets in the way of a meaningful dialogue. They
are resistant to the gospel.3
This discussion is important because churches in North America often
operate almost exclusively in the sphere of m0–m1, as illustrated in
this image.
Many churches in North America function in a sort of Christian
bubble where there are little or no cultural barriers. This problem is
significant because, as we have stated previously, it is we who are the
called, sent, missionary people of God, which will sometimes mean we
must go to where people are. If we fail to go to the people, the only way
they will encounter the gospel meaningfully is by coming to us. This
is the built-in assumption of the attractional church, and it requires
the nonbeliever do the cross-cultural work to find Jesus, and not us!
And make no mistake, for many people, coming to a church service
involves serious cross-cultural work. When we ask them to come to
us, we are in essence asking them to be the missionaries.
Instead, we must see that we are missionary people, sent to participate
with a missionary God, who desires to reconcile all of creation to
Himself for His glory. We, the church, are called to bless and reach
the nations.`,

> "The Word became flesh and blood and moved into the neighborhood" (John 1:14, MSG).

## INCARNATIONAL MISSION

If God's central way of reaching His world was to incarnate Himself, then the church's mission should be incarnational as well.

> "In the incarnation of Jesus, God revealed himself as the One who is with and for his creation. Now, as the Risen Lord sends his Spirit to empower the church, we are called to become God's people present in the world, with and for the world." —Darrell Guder

“In the incarnation of Jesus, God revealed himself as the
One who is with and for his creation. Now, as the Risen
Lord sends his Spirit to empower the church, we are
called to become God’s people present in the world, with
and for the world.” —Darrell Guder
The last two **missiological** principles we examined illuminated the
missionary nature of God and the “sentness” of the church. God is
a missionary God who sends a missionary church. However, being
sent is only part of the story. The language of “**incarnational** mission”
represents the rooting of our lives and the gospel into the place we
live. If the essence of **missional** living is sending, then the heart of
**incarnational** mission is staying.

## THE INCARNATION

The word incarnation comes from a Latin word that literally means
“in the flesh.” It refers to the act whereby God took on human flesh and
entered our world to bring about reconciliation between Himself and
humanity. The incarnation is God’s ultimate **missional** participation in
creation (John 3:16-17). When God entered our world in and through
the person of Jesus, He came to live among us. He **eskénosen**—literally,
“set up a tent.” In simpler terms, “The Word became flesh and blood,
and moved into the neighborhood” (John 1:14, MSG).

# I N C A R N AT I O N A L M I S S I O N

If God’s central way of reaching His world was to incarnate Himself
in Jesus, then our way of reaching the world should likewise be
**incarnational**. It is important to acknowledge that the incarnation
of Jesus was a special, unrepeatable event. Though we will never
be able to embody God the way Jesus does, we ought to be able to
make a distinction between the Incarnation with a capital “I” and
**incarnational** ministry.
Obviously, there is nothing wrong with inviting believers to model
their lives after the life of Jesus. The apostles encouraged Christians to
imitate Christ as a way of identifying with Him. Both Peter and Paul
insisted that Jesus is the model for Christian living. “To this you were
called, because Christ suffered for you, leaving you an example, that
you should follow in his steps” (1 Peter 2:21). Peter makes clear that
Jesus’ life is to be our example. “Follow my example, as I follow the
example of Christ” (1 Corinthians 11:1). And Paul states that we can
follow his way of life because he is so closely following the way of Jesus.
Missiologist Michael Frost elaborates on the theme of following Christ’s
example from the book of Philippians:
Paul makes this point even more strongly in Philippians, in
which he tells us that our “attitude should be the same as
that of Christ Jesus” (Philippians 2:5). We often assume that
this passage then commends to us Jesus’ humility, which is
clearly present in the text. But Jesus’ humility is commended
to us insofar as it is expressed in his commitments to identi­
fication and relinquishment. First, to follow Jesus’ example
means that we should share his profoundly humble identifi­
cation with sinful humankind (Philippians 2:7b-8a). Second,
those of us who wish to emulate Jesus should be aware of
his equally humble willingness to empty himself and make
himself nothing for the sake of God’s redemptive purposes
(Philippians 2:6-7a). … To embrace an **incarnational** ministry,
then, involves a willingness to relinquish our own desires and
interests in the service of others.4
This examination of the Philippians speaks to two very important
ideas related to **incarnational** mission—the concepts of proximity
and presence.
**incarnational** mission involves living in close proximity with others.
We cannot love and serve those God has sent us to from a distance.
Jesus took on flesh and blood and moved into the neighborhood, so
we must do the same. This may require moving geographically to
be closer to those to whom God has sent us. At the very least, it will
demand creating time and space to be directly and actively involved
in the lives of people we are seeking to reach.
The concept of presence moves beyond mere proximity to identifica­
tion and surrender. Jesus identified with and advocated for those who
He was called to serve. As the Philippians passage makes clear, He
humbled Himself. He literally emptied Himself for the sake of others.
This realization reveals an **incarnational** approach that calls us to
relational identification with our neighbors, leading us to tangible
acts of love and sacrifice.
Jesus’ words from John 20:21 are most often used to emphasize the
sending of the disciples and subsequently the church, “As the Father
has sent me, I am sending you.” But we must not neglect the first half
of the passage. Jesus says, “As the Father has sent me …” (emphasis
added). The word “as” (or in some translations “just as”) translates
to “like” or “in a similar manner.” In other words, we need to be sent
like Jesus was sent. To whom and in what manner was Jesus sent?
He was sent to the down and outers of society. He was with and for
tax collectors, the oppressed, the poor, and the diseased. If Jesus is
our example, we are called to do likewise.
In The Incarnation and the Church’s _Witness_, Darrell Guder provides
an insightful summary on the incarnation of Jesus and what it means
to be a Christian.
We arrive at the concept of **incarnational** witness as one way
of expounding on the character of our missionary vocation. In
the incarnation of Jesus Christ, God revealed himself as the One
who is with and for his creation. Now, as the Risen Lord sends
his Spirit to empower the church, we are called to become
God’s people present in the world, with and for the world,
like St. John pointing always to Christ. The most **incarnational**
dimension of our witness is defined by the cross itself, as we
experience with Jesus that bearing his cross transforms our
suffering into witness.
**incarnational** witness is, therefore, a way of describing Chris­
tian vocation in terms of Jesus Christ as the messenger, the
message, and the model for all who follow after him. To speak
of the incarnation missionally is to link who Jesus was, what
Jesus did, and how he did it, in one great event that defines
all that it means to be Christian.5

# N U T S A N D B O LT S

What does all this talk of identification, proximity, and presence have
to do with daily living? It may sound cliché, but it really is all about
relationships. It’s all about getting close enough to people to listen,
understand their hopes and dreams, and coming to love them the
way Jesus does.
The Gospels tell us that Jesus is a friend of sinners. Hear that—a
friend. What constitutes a friend? When another person invites you
to meet their friends, you are in. The Bible is full of stories of people
inviting Jesus to meet and spend time with their friends. People were
drawn to the mysterious love and holiness of Jesus. Someone once
said that people who were not like Jesus liked Jesus. As followers of
Jesus, shouldn’t that also be true of us? That doesn’t happen without
living with and among people. What will it take for you to incarnate
the life of Jesus? What will it take for you to really move into your
neighborhood, perhaps for the very first time?

A fascinating passage in the Old Testament provides a picture of
what it looks like to live out **incarnational** mission. It gives practical
instructions for digging into the places where we live. This is espe­
cially helpful when Christians sense they are living in a world that
is hostile toward their beliefs or living in a place that doesn’t really
feel like home.
In Jeremiah, we read how the nation of Israel had forsaken God’s
law and found themselves taken into captivity, exiled far from their
Jerusalem homeland. God sent the Babylonian empire to discipline
His people. As they were relocated to a foreign, idolatrous land, they
heard whispers that their time in the hostile country would be short.
False prophets began telling the nation of Israel that God would soon
deliver them and settling into this new, strange land was foolish.
God’s word through the prophet Jeremiah was quite the opposite.
Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles
whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon: Build
houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat their produce.
Take wives and have sons and daughters; take wives for your
sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear
sons and daughters; multiply there, and do not decrease. But
seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile,
and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will
find your welfare (Jeremiah 29:4-7, ESV).
The words of Jeremiah were shocking. The premise of his message
was that the exiles would be in Babylon for several generations and
that the Israelites would simply need to come to terms with this fact.
God was telling them to settle down and get used to being in this
hostile, ungodly place.
Jeremiah counseled his community not to be nostalgic for the past,
for the past could not be recovered. He did not advise them to plan
for insurrection, for there was no promise of their restoration in Jeru­
salem, at least not any time soon. Nor was the community’s survival
tied to the remnant that remained in Jerusalem (Jeremiah 24:5-10).
For Jeremiah, exile did not mean that God had abandoned Israel.
Rather, exile was the place where God was at work. God’s purposes
for Israel were served by the Babylonian invasion.
Jeremiah’s instructions were more counterintuitive than they might
at first seem. He tells the Jews to “seek the welfare” of their captors
and pray for the very people who destroyed their homeland, because
the welfare of the exiles and the captors were bound together. If God’s
purposes for Israel were being fulfilled through their captivity, then
as the exiles pursued the shalom of Babylon, God would provide
shalom for those in exile.6
It seemed reasonable for the Jews to be hostile to their captors. It
also would have been natural for them to withdraw from the world
around them. By the same token, it would have been easy for them
to simply assimilate into the Babylonian culture. Any of these options
would have made sense in human terms. But God called the Israelites
to something radically different, not to be defensive against, isolated
from, or absorbed into the dominant culture but instead to be incar­
nated within it.7 He was calling them to dig into the place He had sent
them, to stay where they would be doing life for a long time.
What God instructed the exiles to do is rather ordinary. Consider the
list from Jeremiah 29:
• Build houses and live in them.
• Plant gardens and eat their produce.
• Have children.
• Marry off your children so they have children.
• Seek the welfare of the city.
• Pray for the welfare of the city.
Nothing from this list is dramatic or miraculous. These are normal,
everyday activities. It could represent any person, regardless of
income, social status, education, vocation, or geographical location.
The way the kingdom of God takes root in the lives of people and
ultimately changes a city is by exiles living normal, everyday lives as
citizens of the King in every neighborhood and city. We build houses.
We plant gardens. We have children. We seek the welfare of our city.
Often, the ways of Jesus are indeed local and ordinary.
Are you willing to commit to the welfare of your city? Will you allow
your imagination to see a movement that begins with the local and
ordinary but over time becomes global and extraordinary? If your
answer is yes, then together let’s seek the welfare of our neighbor­
hoods and let us strive for it to spill over into every nook and cranny
of our city.`,

    content: `# PRINCIPLE 4: RETHINK MISSIO DEI

“The main business of many mission committees is to
determine how to spend the mission budget rather than
view the entire congregational budget as an exercise in
mission.” —Darrell Guder
The fourth **missiological** principle is the concept of ****missio Dei**. An
English rendering of this Latin phrase speaks to the “mission of God.”
It is God who has a mission to set things right in a broken, sinful world,
to redeem and restore it to what He has always intended.
Mission is not the invention, responsibility, or program of the church.
Instead, mission flows directly from the character and purposes of a
missionary God. In the words of David Bosch, “It is not the church which
‘undertakes’ mission; it is the **missio Dei** which constitutes the church.”8
It is not only crucial to understand that God has a mission but equally
important to understand that His mission is larger than the church.
We in the church often wrongly assume that the primary activity
of God is in the church, rather than recognizing that God’s primary
activity is in the world and that the church is God’s instrument sent
into the world to participate in His redemptive mission.
Before discussing how to live out a **missio Dei** theology in a practical
manner, let’s consider how the first four **missiological** principles
cohere together. Remember, the first two principles reminded us that
we are a sent missionary people. The third principle instructs that
we are to incarnate or embed our lives and the gospel into the local
context we have been sent. **missio Dei**, then, simply states that God
is already at work in the lives around us and our job is to figure out
what God is doing and how He wants us to participate.
## G O D ’ S M I S S I O N A S T H E O R G A N I Z I N G
# P R I N C I P L E
A **missio Dei** perspective will shape our thinking in the manner we
understand the form and function of the church. Typically, congre­
gations view “missions” as simply one program or activity among
many other equally important functions of the church. Therefore,
the missions program is seen alongside that of worship, small groups,
men’s and women’s ministries, youth and children’s ministries, and
so forth. When missions is viewed in this way, the business of many
mission committees “is to determine how to spend the mission budget
rather than view the entire congregational budget as an exercise in
mission.”9 However, when the church begins to define itself as an
agent of God’s mission, it will begin to organize every activity of the
church around the **missio Dei**.
Mission as the organizing principle means that mission goes
way beyond being some sort of optional activity or program
for our churches. It actually is the organizing axis of the church.
The life of the church revolves around it. This is not to say
that we don’t do corporate worship, develop community, and
make disciples, but that these are catalyzed by and organized
around the mission function. Only in this way can we be truly
**missional**. Merely adding serving events or special outreach
days to our church schedules will not develop **missional** people
nor make a **missional** church.10
To ensure clarity on this issue of God’s mission as the organizing
# principle for all activities of the church, let me state again that this
does not minimize the need for and importance of the other functions
of the church. It is simply stating that no other function of the church
can rightly be the organizing principle or the reason we come together
in the first place. Worship should not be the organizing principle.
Community should not be the organizing principle. Even evangelism
should not be the organizing principle.
Instead, worship, community, **discipleship**, evangelism, and every
other important activity of the church are properly understood and
initiated only when viewed through the lens of mission. Pause for a
moment and examine the image below.
The first image represents some activities of a local church. Most
churches have ministries for arts or worship, children, small groups,
youth, and so forth. However, one of the problems with a list like this,
is that “missions” becomes just one activity of the church, alongside
several other equally important aspects. These images illustrate the

move from “missions” as one among many functions of the church
to “mission” being the organizing principle for all other activities or
ministries of the church.11
If we believe the church is really all about God’s mission, then God’s
mission should inform everything else we do as a church. As the
second image shows, we should remove the “s” of missions and put
mission at the top to illustrate that the **missio Dei** should shape, or at
least influence, every other program and activity of the church.
# G O D ’ S M I S S I O N A S T H E
# S TA R T I N G P O I N T
Determining where and how we engage in God’s mission is the
second way a **missio Dei** theology influences our activity. If the
mission is God’s, and it is, then how do we step into it? How do we
truly participate in what God is doing? Geoffrey Harris provides
these helpful words:
The average church member may be reassured to know
that mission is instigated by the simple act of praying, and
of listening to God, and following God’s guidance. In such
fundamental activities all Christians can participate. In addi­
tion, it is reassuring to know that God’s Spirit is at work in the
world prior to our engagement in any relationship or any
work of mission. The presence of God in the world means that
anyone embarking upon God’s mission already has an ally
and accomplice in the work. It becomes “mission alongside”
rather than mission alone.12
# F O U R S T E P S T O WA R D
# M I S S I O N A L E N G A G E M E N T
Practically speaking, what does it look like to do mission alongside
what God is already doing? If it is God’s mission and not ours, how
do we know where, when, and how to participate? The answer, at
least in part, is that we must look for God’s activity in a local setting
as the place to begin our **missional** engagement. Let me introduce
one way to determine what God’s local mission is and how a church
body can begin to participate in it.
# 1. DISCOVER
If it is truly God’s mission and not ours, then we must first discover
how God is at work. The first step in discovering what God is doing is
through listening. Individually and collectively, we must cultivate our
ability to listen well on three fronts: to the Spirit, to the local community,
and to each other. It is impossible to ascertain the movement of God
without carving out significant time to listen to His voice through
prayer and Scripture, as well as the voices of those we desire to serve.
If the first step is about discovering, then the first question must be,
“What is God doing in this place?”
Mission cannot be decided beforehand. It must be decided in relation
to God’s activity in a local context. Instead of front-loading mission
strategies with what we think a community needs, we begin by
listening and learning what God is already doing. Only after discov­
ering what God is doing in a particular setting do we then ask how
He wants us to participate.
# 2. DISCERN
In addition to listening, participating in God’s mission will involve
discernment. Not only will we need to discover what God is already
doing, but we will need to ask the follow-up question, “In light of our
gifts and resources, how does God want us to participate in what He is
doing?” The fact is that we can’t do it all, which is true for both individual
followers of Jesus as well as local congregations. But it is also true that
God has gifted us all to do something! The point of discernment is to
determine where and how to participate in God’s mission.
## 3. DO
This may seem obvious, but the processes of discovery and discern­
ment are useless if we do not obey what God is calling us to do. We
must acknowledge that following Jesus will often be costly. Therefore,
we need to ask, “Will we be obedient to costly discernment?” Or will
we put conditions on our obedience? Someone once said that you
shouldn’t ask God to guide your steps if you are not willing to move
your feet.
# 4. DEBRIEF
Throughout the process of engaging God’s mission, we must create
opportunities to reflect on our **missional** involvement. Sometimes this
may simply mean we need individual “down time” to reflect upon
our activities. We may need to ask God to affirm our involvement or
to ask for clarity. But it will also mean carving out time to reflect with
others among our faith community. We need to hear what others are
seeing and sensing concerning God’s activities and to hear the stories
of how others are engaging God’s mission. It is important for us to
offer feedback on what we are sensing.
These four steps toward **missional** engagement help to put emphasis
on the context God has sent us to and on how God has already been
working in that place long before we ever arrived.`,

“In ******Christendom**** the emphasis was on maintaining a
supposedly Christian status quo, but in post-****Christendom****
it is on mission within a contested environment.”
> —Stuart Murray
Remember the famous line from The Wizard of Oz, when Dorothy
first arrives in Oz and realizes she is now in a world that is strangely
different? “Toto,” she says to her little dog, “I’ve a feeling we’re not in
Kansas anymore.” Dorothy’s surroundings were suddenly unfamiliar.
The people and places she was used to seeing no longer existed. She
had no idea where she was, but one thing was certain—everything
around her had drastically changed.13
A place that is strangely different describes the world around the
church today. Culture has seemingly changed so quickly and radically
that many churches feel like exiles in a foreign land. Like Dorothy,
many churches no longer recognize their surroundings. They don’t
completely understand the changes that have taken place. They only
know that things are not like they used to be.
# C H R I S T E N D O M T O
# P O S T- C H R I S T E N D O M
Numerous factors have influenced the change we see in Western
culture. Issues such as globalization, urbanization, post-modernism,
and the rise of the information age have significantly influenced the
church. However, nothing has shaken the foundations of the church
over the centuries as much as the rise and fall of ****Christendom****.
In 313 A. D., the Roman Emperor Constantine adopted the Christian
faith as his own and decided to replace paganism with Christianity
as the official imperial religion. He brought the church in from the
margins of society, where it had been operating for the previous three
centuries and united it with the empire. By giving great resources and
favors to the church, Constantine set in motion a process that would
eventually bring all of Europe into a church-state relationship known
as ****Christendom****. It is difficult to overstate the impact Constantine’s
decision had on the Christian faith. A few of the changes that took
place included:
•	 The assumption that all citizens were Christian by birth
•	 Infant baptism as the symbol of necessary incorporation into
the Christian society
•	 Sunday as the required day of church attendance, with penal­
ties for noncompliance
•	 The definition of “orthodoxy” as the common belief shared
by all, determined by powerful church leaders supported by
the state
•	 The construction of massive and ornate church buildings
•	 A strong distinction between clergy and laity and the relega­
tion of the laity to a largely passive role
•	 The increased wealth of the church and the obligation of
required tithes to fund the system
•	 The division of the globe into either “****Christendom****” or
“heathendom” and the waging of war in the name of Christ
and the church
•	 The use of political and military force to impose the Christian
faith14
The net effect of ****Christendom**** was that Christianity moved from being
a dynamic, revolutionary, social, and spiritual movement to being a
static religious institution with corresponding structures, priesthood,
and rituals. The Christian faith moved from an integrated way of life
that was lived out seven days a week to an obligation that was fulfilled
by attending a service at a set time.
By the middle of the 20th century, however, it was becoming clear
in Europe that ****Christendom**** was in serious decline. People began
to use the term “post-****Christendom****” to describe the church’s loss of
social privilege. Others used it to refer to Western civilizations that
no longer considered themselves to be Christian.
In the era of post-****Christendom****, the church returned to the margins
of society, losing prominence and control. While once the majority,
the church became the minority. The shift from once being on the
margins of society, elevated to a place of control, then back again to
the margins is illustrated in this image.15
Before Constantine, the dominant influence in society was the Roman
Empire and the church was a marginalized sect, located on the
outskirts. However, while the church operated on the margins, we
know from Paul’s Epistles and early church history that the church
was making serious inroads into the Roman Empire. The second circle
represents ****Christendom**** when the church became the dominant seat
of culture, albeit corrupted with political and military power. Today,
the picture is of a church that has been relegated back to the margins.
However, it is important to note that while those outside the church
understood that ****Christendom**** was fading, many inside the church
struggled to realize the church was losing its footing. Consequently, the
church was at a loss as to how to reach into the changing pluralistic,
postmodern culture that had little interest in it.
# W H AT D I F F E R E N C E D O E S I T M A K E ?
The difficulty the church is experiencing today in trying to relate to
culture is in large part due to our ****Christendom**** heritage. Many in the
church still believe that Christianity is in a place of influence and
significance and operate under the false assumption that ****Christendom****
is alive and well. While there may be some parts of the country that
still cling to Christian values, most of the population is rapidly moving

Prevailing Inﬂuencer of Culture

away from the things associated with the church. In the eyes of many
outside the church, the church has become completely irrelevant.
The decline of Christian influence in North America can be seen in
multiple ways. The most prominent is the continual drop in church
attendance. But it doesn’t end there. In fact, every indicator that can
be used to measure church health is headed in the wrong direction.
Conversions. Baptisms. Membership. Retention. Participation. Giving.
Religious literacy. Effects on the culture. Look at it from any direction.
Everything is in decline.16
This is an enormous problem. While the church is less effective at
reaching a changing world, many in the church continue to believe
that it maintains a central role in culture. Instead of leaning toward
the missionary vision of the church, we default to church as a place
where certain things happen and wrongly assume that those outside
the church will be interested in what we do. But every statistic proves
that simply isn’t the case.
Like Dorothy arriving in Oz, we must not forget that the religious
landscape around us has drastically changed. We are in a new land.
At times we may feel like exiles. But unlike many exiles, let us not
yearn for what once was. Instead, let us seek to bring life and vitality
to the land where God has placed us. Let us pray and toil for God’s
kingdom to come to the cities and neighborhoods in which we live.
This may be a hard pill to swallow, but the reality is that North America
is not a Christian place. Like Dorothy, we’re not in Kansas anymore!
The sooner we can come to grips with that reality, the sooner we can
return to the revolutionary, **missional** movement exemplified for us
in the early church.`,

“To be a stranger in a strange land, to be lost ... is per­
haps the condition most typical of contemporary life.”
> —Iain Chambers
The film Avalon is a story of an extended family who arrives in America
in the early 1900s. Avalon is the name of the neighborhood where
the family members settled. The first half of the film highlights the
integration of the extended family. Life in Avalon is lived with others
and rooted not only in relationships but also in place.
However, halfway through the film, three themes fragment the family:
suburbs, automobiles, and televisions. The rise of suburbs creates
physical distance between extended family members. The afford­
ability of automobiles enables the families to live in the suburbs, but
the fathers then spend less time at home as they commute to their
jobs. And the popularity of television leads to dinners in front of a
screen instead of conversations around a table. The film ends with
the resulting alienation and isolation of the extended family.17
The Great Good Place by Ray Oldenburg highlights similarities I noticed
in Avalon. Oldenburg contends that most communities in the United
States are void of relational vitality, primarily because of the loss of
what he calls informal public places. He understands the absence
of informal public life as the result of suburban sprawl and the rise
of the automobile culture, both of which foster geographical and
relational separation between home and workplace. The problem
is magnified by home entertainment that often inhibits face-to-face
communication. Today, this issue has moved far beyond the intro­
duction of television as portrayed in Avalon. Smartphones, computers,
tablets, gaming devices, and streaming services provide limitless
viewing options.
The warning that Oldenburg sounded over 30 years ago remains
relevant today:
The problem of place in America manifests itself in a sorely defi­
cient informal public life. The structure of shared experience
beyond that offered by family, job, and passive consumerism is
small and dwindling. The essential group experience is being
replaced by the exaggerated self-consciousness of individuals.
American life-styles, for all the material acquisition and the
seeking after comforts and pleasures, are plagued by boredom,
loneliness, alienation, and a high price tag. America can point
to many areas where she has made progress, but in the area
of informal public life she has lost ground and continues to
lose it.18
# L O O K AT A L L T H E L O N E LY P E O P L E
The way of life in developed countries is greatly reducing the quan­
tity and quality of our relationships. Most people no longer live in
extended families or even near each other. When you add the high
degree of mobility, a strong sense of individualism, and decreased
opportunities for informal public life, isolation and loneliness become
increasingly common.
While studies show that we are now actually “connected” to a larger
and more diverse circle of people, nearly a quarter of Americans say
they have nobody to talk to. In 1985, that figure was 8 percent.19 And
this is not simply a picture of solitary retirees. Middle-aged people
are the loneliest group in the United States. According to one study,
40 percent of adults ages 45–49 said they were lonely, up from 20
percent in the 1980s.20
The issue of isolation is compounded by a sense of detachment from
place. In a highly mobile society, people rarely feel rooted geographi­
cally. We live as nomads, both figuratively and literally. But God created
us as social, relational beings. We are created to be in a relationship
with the Creator but also to be in relationships with other people.
We have been formed with an innate need to know and be known.
# W O R D B E C A M E F L E S H A N D B L O O D
What then is the appropriate response to a culture of increasing
displacement? Can something turn the tide of isolation? What practical
actions can be taken to mend the broken pieces? To restore people
and places to flourish?
The solution is no doubt multifaceted. It will involve a variety of
tactics: engaging with our neighbors, restoring genuine community,
sharing meals with others, welcoming strangers, and opening our
lives to those who are disconnected. But in all of the practical actions,
the how must be rooted in the why of **incarnational** presence. The
journey of restoring the relational fabric of our communities must
begin with our tangible presence in the place where God has called us.`,

## B I V O C AT I O N A L A N D C O V O C AT I O N A L

# E N G A G E M E N T

Often the language of bivocational invokes the thought of two distinct
vocations. To help us reconnect the two, we might use the language
of “covocation.” The prefix “co” is the reduced form of the Latin com
which means “together” or “in common.” English words like cofounder,
copilot, or companion are examples of words that denote partnership
and equality.
Covocation embodies the reality that if a person is called to be a
dentist, teacher, web-designer, or plumber and also called to start
a church, the different callings are not isolated from one another.
Instead, they are interlinked and equal. The language of covocation
pushes against the temptation to compartmentalize different aspects
of our lives. When we begin to understand that each of our callings
are legitimate and necessary aspects of God’s mission, they can be
leveraged together for His purposes.
Perhaps the most significant benefit of being bivocational or covoca­
tional is that it provides the planter greater opportunities to connect
relationally with people in the community. Some people have referred
to this as “marketplace mission” because relationships develop as a
result of the planter’s vocational connections. Their marketplace job
is not a hindrance to what God is doing but an advantage to engaging
God’s mission.
Being bivocational or covocational gives planters access to a mission
field that is not readily available to a pastor who is employed full-time
by a local church. Many of these pastors find themselves working
inside a church bubble, spending most of their time talking with
church people about church things. Even when a pastor makes
the effort to engage people in their community, they often find it
challenging to fully relate. It is not until a person incarnates into the
local context that they begin to understand the values and interests
of the people in their community.
Bivocational or covocational ministry also helps to diminish the sacred
and secular divide with respect to vocation. The congregation can see
the planter model the truth that all vocations are sacred. Whatever
work God has called a person to do, it is a sacred calling. As a result, the
benefits of being in the marketplace are multiplied exponentially as
every member recognizes how their vocation fits into God’s mission.
Another **missional** benefit is that working in an occupation in the
community builds credibility with those outside the church. In a
post-Christian context, where people are skeptical of the church, it
is important for non-Christians to see that church planters have jobs
like everyone else. In a time when Christianity doesn’t have the best
reputation, it can provide significant “street-cred” with those outside
the church.

# F I N A N C I A L S TA B I L I T Y

Another major benefit of bivocational or covocational ministry relates
to the financial stability it provides in at least three different areas.

# 1. THE PLANTER

When the primary financial support comes from a marketplace
source rather than the church, there is usually less financial strain
on a family. This is especially true when the planter is employed
full-time in a vocation that provides benefits like insurance, vacation,
and retirement.

# 2. THE CHURCH

A church led by bivocational or covocational planters usually finds
its financial base is much stronger. Without the need to provide full-
time salaries and benefits, the church can put more of its financial
resources into ministry.

# 3. THE CHURCH PLANTING ENTITY

Many denominations plan to plant hundreds, if not thousands, of
churches over the next several years. Bivocational and covocational
ministry provides the opportunity for funding entities to embrace more
sustainable church **multiplication** practices. This is especially necessary
for planters who are engaging in socioeconomically diverse contexts.
Many traditional church plants start with a large annual budget
supported by multiple funding streams, including partnering
churches and denominational entities. Because most funding models
are structured over 3–5 years, it puts pressure on the planter to grow
the church quickly so it can become self-sustaining before funding
runs out. The unfortunate reality is that a planter is often forced to
attract financial givers rather than engaging in the brokenness in
their community. Bivocational or covocational ministry provides a
more viable financial model that allows the planter to focus primarily
on mission.
This move towards planting more churches with bivocational or
covocational planters must start by rethinking vocation. We need
to help people see that regardless of what God has called them to
do in the marketplace, their work matters and can align with God’s
redemptive purposes.`,

“Movement occurs when the making of mis­
sion-shaped disciples—who live in the world for the
sake of the world, in the way of Christ—goes viral.”
> —J. R. Woodward and Dan White, Jr.
In 1,000 Churches by Ed Stetzer and Daniel Im, they discuss rapid repro­
duction of churches and compare the gestation periods of elephants
and rabbits. Elephants carry one calf for a gestation period of nearly
two years then nurse it for three years after birth before reproducing
again. On the other hand, rabbits carry a litter of typically 14 babies
for just one month. Then, in a matter of minutes after giving birth, that
rabbit can become pregnant again, repeating the cycle. There may be
a time and a place when an elephant-type approach is appropriate in
the church. But if our goal is rapid church **multiplication**, then we must
strive toward a movement that, as the saying goes, “breeds like rabbits.”21
# M U LT I P L I C AT I O N I S A M I N D S E T
Perhaps the first thing that should be said regarding church planting
and movements is that it has to be a mindset. We must have a “rabbit”
kind of mentality that will not only change the way we think about
church, mission, and **multiplication**, but it will begin to shape the
very way we function as the church.
Albert Einstein’s famous quote rings true here, “We can’t solve prob­
lems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created
them.” If we apply that to the church, then, “We cannot solve the
problems of the church by using the same kind of thinking we used
when we created those problems in the first place.” We can’t keep
thinking and doing what we have already done and expect different
results. We must rethink how we understand and live out the life of
the church if we wish to see a **multiplication** movement.
Make it a discipline to think movement, not institution. If you identify
yourself as a movement, then you will eventually start acting like one.
# T H E M A K E U P O F A
# M U LT I P L I C AT I O N M O V E M E N T
What are the tangible characteristics of multiplying churches? Here
are four aspects that contribute to a movement culture.
# 1. GOD’S MISSION IS CENTRAL.
A church that is focused on real movement has a strong emphasis
on the **missio Dei**. It is God who has a mission to set things right in a
broken world, to redeem and restore it to what He always intended.
A movement church understands that mission is not the invention,
responsibility, or program of the church. Instead, they see that mission
flows directly from the character and purposes of a missionary God.
A multiplying church not only understands that the mission is God’s
but also recognizes that His mission is larger than their individual
church. They live out the reality that God’s primary activity is in the
world and that their responsibility is to be sent into the world to
participate in what He is already doing. As a result, the church does not
simply send missionaries. They view their church as the missionary.
# 2. ALL OF GOD’S PEOPLE ARE
# ACTIVATED.
**multiplication** movements only succeed when they equip all of God’s
people. Every believer has potential to change the world. This transfor­
mation occurs more often through the ordinary than the extraordinary.
Our job as church leaders is to bring it out. As Tim Keller describes
this movement, “In every seed is the potential for a tree, and in every
tree the potential for a forest, but all of this is contained in the initial
seed.”22 In a movement church, everyone gets to play. No one sits on
the bench.
# 3. ADAPTIVE LEADERSHIP AND
# ADAPTIVE STRUCTURES
A movement church has leadership that knows how to move a church
and keep it moving. This type of leadership highlights apostolic and
prophetic roles. The apostolic person leads with a positive vision of what
can be, while the prophetic tends to call the status quo into question.
**multiplication** needs adaptive leadership, people who can help the
church transition to a different, nimbler version of itself. Such leaders
don’t necessarily have to be highly creative innovators, but they must
be people who can move the church into adaptive modes capable of
tackling adaptive challenges. These people create the conditions for
change and innovation.
In movement-focused churches, the effectiveness of the leaders is
not measured by what they accomplish but by how the people of
God are equipped, organized, and inspired to participate in God’s
mission in the world. This leadership and structure is geared toward
disciple-making. In the makeup of a movement, **discipleship** is the
engine for everything. Without it, the church will drift away from
its core calling.
As J. R. Woodward and Dan White write:
Movement occurs when the making of mission-shaped disci­
ples—who live in the world for the sake of the world, in the way
of Christ—goes viral. Movement is about developing structures
and systems that catapult people into mission, where repro­
ducing **discipleship** groups, **missional** communities, churches
and networks of churches is a natural part of its DNA. It’s the
ripple effect: throwing a rock into a pond creates one ripple and
then another and another, till ripples cover the whole pond.23
## 4. ****APEST****, WITH EMPHASIS ON THE A
We will examine ****APEST**** in principle 9, but for a quick summary,
it denotes the roles of apostle, prophet, evangelist, shepherd, and
teacher in Ephesians 4. Keller notes that all ****APEST**** ministries are vital,
but the apostolic role leads to movement. As Keller writes, “This is
not an emphasis of importance or priority; it is one of purpose and
design.”24 Apostolic people push against current boundaries and
propel Christianity into new areas. If you remove apostolic leaders,
you won’t see **multiplication** movement.`,

“In the New Testament there are functional distinctions
between various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical
division between clergy and laity.” —Howard Snyder
There is an adage that speaks to the importance of change in an
organization. The saying goes, “We are perfectly designed to achieve
what we are currently achieving.” If we apply this statement to the
church, a question we might ask is: are we satisfied with what we
are currently achieving? In other words, are we totally content with
the impact the church is having? If we are totally honest, the answer
would likely be a resounding no.
If we are perfectly designed to achieve what the church is currently
achieving, then shouldn’t we ask if there is an issue in the way we
are designed? Or at least question if there is an issue in the way we
understand the nature of the church and its place in God’s mission?
Are there “design” factors that we need to rethink to achieve the
outcomes we desire?
Part of the solution is found in rethinking the nature of the church,
mission, culture, **multiplication**, and vocation. However, I believe
there is also an organizational issue to be addressed. The church
must activate every member of the body.
# C L E R G Y- L A I T Y D I V I D E
Before we address how to look at the gifting and functions of the
body of Christ, let’s consider a general view of leadership that has
kept the church from fully realizing its calling. I am referring to what
is considered the clergy-laity divide.
The word laity comes from a Greek word laos, meaning “people of God.”
Today we often use the related term “layperson” to distinguish from
“professional.” A layperson is someone in a particular discipline who
is seen as an “amateur” who dabbles in an area but doesn’t operate
with a high level of skill or expertise. The professional, on the other
hand, is the expert. While there may be a place for this division in
the business world and sports, there is no biblical basis for such a
distinction in the church.
As Eugene Peterson writes
Within the Christian community there are few words that are
more disabling than “layperson” and “laity.” The words convey
the impression—an impression that quickly solidifies into a
lie—that there is a two-level hierarchy among the men and
women who follow Jesus. There are those who are trained,
sometimes referred to as “the called,” the professionals who
are paid to preach, teach, and provide guidance in the Christian
way, occupying the upper level. The lower level is made up of
everyone else, those whom God assigned jobs as storekeepers,
lawyers, journalists, parents, and computer programmers.25
Ministry is not set aside for some professional class within the church.
All the people of God are called and commissioned. In The Community
of the *King*, Howard Snyder speaks to this issue:
The New Testament doctrine of ministry rests not on the clergy-
laity distinction but on the twin and complementary pillars of
the priesthood of all believers and the gifts of the Spirit. Today,
four centuries after the Reformation, the full implications of this
Protestant affirmation have yet to be worked out. The clergy-laity
dichotomy is a direct carry-over from pre-Reformation Roman
Catholicism and a throwback to the Old Testament priesthood.
It is one of the principal obstacles to the church effectively
being God’s agent of the Kingdom today because it creates a
false idea that only “holy men,” namely, ordained ministers, are
really qualified and responsible for leadership and significant
ministry. In the New Testament there are functional distinctions
between various kinds of ministries but no hierarchical division
between clergy and laity.26
We must “de-professionalize” ministry and give it back to the people of
God. However, this does not mean we don’t have leaders. Any signif­
icant **multiplication** movement that makes an impact has definitive
leadership, but we cannot confuse leadership with a call to participate
in Jesus’ redemptive mission.
When we look at the early church, we see that everyone is regarded as
a significant agent of the King and has a place in the unfolding of the
movement. In other words, in the church that Jesus built, everyone
gets to play. In fact, everyone must play!

So if we are to activate all of God’s people for mission, how do we
accomplish this task? Part of the solution to diminishing the clergy-laity
divide and helping the laos engage in mission and ministry involves
broadening our concept of ministry. We need to move beyond ministry
being framed simply by the traditional pastor-teacher model of the
church to a fivefold understanding of ministry giftings as described
in Ephesians 4:1-16.
This fivefold framework is often referred to as ****APEST****: apostle, prophet,
evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. Most of the time, Ephesians 4 is
viewed as a leadership text. In other words, we understand the gifts
mentioned as leaders given to the church for the purpose of equipping
the people of God. However, Ephesians 4 is about the ministry of the
church. It is a body of Christ text. Paul is stating that the gifts given to
the church are given to the laos—the whole people of God.
At the heart of this letter is Paul’s understanding and description of
the essential ministry of the church. Consider it this way:
•	 In Ephesians 4:1-6, Paul calls us to realize our fundamental
unity in the one God.
•	 In Ephesians 4:7-11, he says that ****APEST**** has been given to the
church by Christ.
•	 In Ephesians 4:12-16, he says why ****APEST**** is given to build up,
reach unity, and become mature.
Paul outlines in simple terms the core ministries that make up the
body of Christ. He clearly states that Christ has given certain gifts to
each one and distributed them throughout the body as He sees fit.
The ministry of the church is unmistakably stated as being at least
fivefold in form through expression in the giftings of apostle, prophet,
evangelist, shepherd, and teacher. And it is through the diversity of
****APEST**** that the church can operate in the fullness of Christ.
The word equip in verse 12 is an interesting word choice. It was often
used to describe the setting of a broken bone or alignment. Paul is
saying that each of the ministries within ****APEST**** add to the ability
of the entire body to function properly. Our ability to grow, mature,
and become the church that Jesus intended is directly linked to the
ministries within ****APEST****.
Sadly, most churches operate with only two out of the five: shepherding
and teaching. In most cases, the ministries of the apostle, prophet, and
evangelist have been minimized, if not completely relegated to the
margins. When we do this, we essentially cut off three-fifths of our
capacity to grow and mature as the body of Christ. This has damaged
the church’s ability to be the fullness of Jesus in the world.
# A P E S T S U M M A R Y
Here are summaries of each ****APEST**** ministry.
# APOSTLE: SENT AND EXTENDS
The word apostle literally means “sent one.” The Latin form is missio,
which is where we get the English word mission. The apostle is most
responsible to activate, develop, and protect the missionary sentness
of the church. This sent quality gives the apostle’s life a catalytic
influence, often playing the role of an entrepreneur at the forefront
of new ventures. They are the cultural architects who are concerned
with the overall extension of Christianity throughout society. Because
of this, they are often drawn to issues related to design, systems, and
overarching organizational structures. They have a **missional** focus
to their ministry.
# PROPHET: QUESTIONS AND REFORMS
Prophets are sensitive to God and what is important to Him. They
often sense what truth needs to be emphasized for their time and
place. Prophets are guardians of the covenant relationship. Whether
it is in the church, society, or an organizational setting, prophets are
quick to recognize the gap between “what is” and “what should be.”
The weight of this tension leads prophets to question the status quo
as well as initiate efforts for reform. Ultimately, they are not satisfied
until they see a “closing of the gap” between God’s demands and our
covenantal faithfulness. This desire to see the truth of God’s reality
fleshed out in concrete and tangible ways gives an **incarnational**
quality to their ministry.
# EVANGELIST: RECRUITS AND GATHERS
Evangelists communicate the message of the gospel in joyous, infec­
tious ways. They enjoy meeting new people and wooing them into
a friendship. They are avid communicators of ideas and often share
their thoughts and feelings in convincing ways. They are recruiters to
the cause and find fulfillment in helping people get caught up into the
driving narrative of the church—the gospel of the kingdom. As bearers
of good news, they have an attractional quality to their ministry.
# SHEPHERD: PROTECTS AND PROVIDES
Shepherds protect the community from danger and provide for its
needs on both an individual and communal level. They notice when
people are alone or hurting and feel drawn to nurture the spiritual
and communal health of the church. They are loyal to the organization
and the people within it. They ensure the community is experienced
as a safe and loving environment, giving their ministry a distinctly
communal focus.
# TEACHER: UNDERSTANDS AND EXPLAINS
Teachers find great satisfaction in helping people learn truth and
wisdom. They grasp complex, systemic truths then help people
understand them. They often formulate curriculum and pathways
of learning. They ensure the truths of Scripture are passed from
generation to generation. Their ministry could be summarized as
instructional in nature.27

When considering the importance of developing a team, it is essential
to note that there isn’t a single solution for every context. However,
developing a multiplying church that is effectively engaging its context
will no doubt involve team dynamics that are informed by the fivefold
typology of Ephesians 4.
Practically speaking, how do you incorporate ****APEST**** into the devel­
opment of a team?
1.	Understand your gifts considering ****APEST**** because it will
influence where you focus your ministry. Example: A teacher
will focus on a Sunday gathering to teach.
2.	Understand the makeup of your team and recognize what
gifts may be missing. If you are a gifted shepherd, you need
someone apostolic or you will never start something new. But
likewise, if you are apostolic, you must have a shepherd or you
will likely push people too hard and run the risk of burnout.
3.	Determine how each gift will have equal input into the mission
and ministry of the church. Remember that a key aspect of
Ephesians 4 is that the church will not reach maturity unless
all five gifts are activated and exercised.
4.	Determine how to ensure the equipping of the saints. How will
you encourage and empower those with the gift of teaching to
equip other teachers? How will those who have an apostolic
calling fan the flame of other sent ones? How will the evan­
gelist equip others who have an evangelistic calling?
5.	Measure success. How will you measure success from an
****APEST**** perspective? How can APEST become a mark of the
church?
If these are functions of the community, here is one way to frame
measuring language to determine how the church is doing in each
area:
•	 A: **missional** impact
•	 P: covenant faithfulness
•	 E: gospel proclamation
•	 S: reconciled community
•	 T: deep wisdom
Remember, a church that can bring together, encourage, and capture
the gifting of a fully functioning team will succeed in whatever it is
seeking to achieve. ****APEST**** adds a necessary ingredient to the overall
**missional** fitness and maturity of the church but must be informed
and shaped by the others to anchor the church in the fullness of
Christ’s nature and mission.

Amid conversations surrounding ****APEST****, there are occasionally ques­
tions regarding the significance of Ephesians 4. Some will ask, “Are
we putting too much emphasis on ****APEST****, especially when it seems
to be based on one passage of Scripture?” A second question often
includes the other gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians and Romans 12.
People ask why the gifts in Ephesians 4 are given prominence over
gifts mentioned elsewhere in the New Testament.
The following responses should help address concerns you may have
when considering ****APEST****.
1.	Biblical commentators have long-held Ephesians as a consti­
tutional document of the church. Like all constitutions, it is
meant to guide subsequent thinking and action in the orga­
nization. The book represents the best way to think about the
church—at least how Paul understood it.
2.	Ephesians 4:1-16 presents a promise that no other passage of
Scripture claims: maturity and fullness of Christ (vv. 11-16).
If we desire unity (vv. 1-6) and strive for maturity (vv. 11-16),
then it is difficult to discount the connection point between
unity and maturity with the diversity of gifts given by Christ
in verses 7-11.
3.	Ephesians 4 is not the only passage in which ****APEST**** is
mentioned.
•	 Apostle is used over 80 times in the New Testament.
•	 Prophet is used nearly 800 times in Scripture, over 150
times in the New Testament.
•	 Evangelist is used in Acts and 2 Timothy.
•	 Shepherd is used 23 times in the New Testament.
•	 Teacher is used 129 times in the New Testament.
•	 The word pastor, which we have no problem using as
the catch-all for leadership, is used once, and it is in
Ephesians 4.
4.	If you struggle to think about these gifts as personal callings
or vocations (they are certainly not roles or offices), then at
least consider them as communal functions of the church.
Should the church be apostolic? Prophetic? Evangelistic? Is
the church to be a shepherding and teaching community? The
answer to each of these questions is a resounding yes! These
five functions should define what the church does.
5.	The key word in 1 Corinthians is “manifestations” or gifts of
the Spirit. The gifts are tools given to execute the calling. The
key word in Romans 12 is “praxis,” which is skill-based, while
Ephesians 4 are callings given to the body by Jesus. The callings
in Ephesians 4 are the people. Think of them as how we are
wired instead of spiritual gifts given to a person. Compare the
distinction between the passages to being a carpenter. If my
calling is to be a carpenter, I am wired and gifted at carpentry
work. However, as a carpenter I have several tools that I will
use including a level, saw, hammer, and router.
Or consider the spiritual gift of hospitality. Someone wired as
a shepherd may provide hospitality as they desire to welcome
people into their home. But someone wired apostolically may
be hospitable because they want to start something new and
welcome others into that new adventure. The gift is the same,
but the motivation is different.
6.	Recognize the gifts are given to the church at Jesus’ ascension.
Why, in His ascension, does Jesus bestow the fivefold approach
on the church?
•	 We become equipped, perfected, or completed
(Ephesians 4:12).
•	 We can live out the unity described in Ephesians 4:1-6
(Ephesians 4:13).
•	 We grow into maturity, so we attain the fullness of Christ
•	 We are not given to theological fads or deception and
will stand firm (Ephesians 4:14).
•	 We grow up into Christ, our head (Ephesians 4:15).
•	 We will be rightly ordered in our relationship to our
head and to each other as His body (Ephesians 4:15-16).
7.	Consider ****APEST**** to be broader than Ephesians 4. Some would
argue that we can actually see ****APEST**** in the created order,
not just the church. In other words, ****APEST**** is laced by God
throughout His creation. Are there teachers in society? Shep­
herds? Evangelists?
Further, and this is incredibly significant, ****APEST**** is incorporated
fully into the life of Jesus. He is the perfect archetype of each
gift. He is the ultimate Apostle, the perfect Prophet, the good
news Evangelist, the Good Shepherd, and the great Teacher.`,
