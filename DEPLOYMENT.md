# 🚀 Rethink Book - Deployment Guide

## GitHub Repository Setup

After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/rethink-book.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```
